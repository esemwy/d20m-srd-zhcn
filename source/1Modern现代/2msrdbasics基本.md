# THE BASICS

## DICE NOTATION

### These rules use the following die notations:

* d4 = four sided die
* d6 = six sided die
* d8 = eight sided die
* d10 = ten sided die
* d12 = twelve sided die
* d20 = twenty sided die
* d% = percentile dice (a number between 1 and 100 is generated by rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before rolling) is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.)

### Die rolls are expressed in the format:

**\[#\] die type \[+/- modifiers\]**

Example: 3d6+2 means: "Roll 3 six sided dice. Add the result of the three dice together. Add 2."

### ROUNDING FRACTIONS

In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.

Exception: Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.

### MULTIPLYING

Sometimes a special rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as youâ€™re applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or more multipliers apply, however, combine them into a single multiple, with each extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple. Thus, a double (x2) and a double (x2) applied to the same number results in a triple (x3, because 2 + 1 = 3).

### BASIC TASK RESOLUTION SYSTEM

These rules assume a standardized system for determining the success or failure of any given task. That system is:

d20 + Modifiers vs. Target Number

The Modifiers and Target Number are determined by the type of task.

If the result of the d20 roll + the Modifiers equals or exceeds the Target Number, the test is successful. Any other result is a failure.

A "natural 20" on the die roll is not an automatic success. A "natural 1" on the die roll is not an automatic failure, unless the rules state otherwise.
