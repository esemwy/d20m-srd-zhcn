ADVANCED CLASSES

An advanced class represents a focus and a calling for the experienced adventurer. It provides a specialization and a range of power and ability to give a character that something extra to set him or her apart.
Although each advanced class naturally builds from a certain basic class, every advanced class is available to all characters who fulfill the prerequisites of the class, regardless of what basic classes they have gained levels in. The associations between basic classes and advanced classes are summarized on the following table.

|Basic Class\*|Advanced Class|
|:------------|:-------------|
|Strong|Soldier; Martial Artist|
|Fast|Gunslinger; Infiltrator|
|Tough|Daredevil; Bodyguard|
|Smart|Field Scientist; Techie, Mage|
|Dedicated|Field Medic; Investigator, Acolyte|
|Charismatic|Personality; Negotiator|

\* The given basic class provides the fastest path to both of the associated advanced classes, though not the only path.

The Gamemaster may add advanced classes specifically suited to his or her campaign. Conversely, the GM can decide that certain advanced classes aren’t available in the campaign. Check with your GM before selecting an advanced class.

Qualifying for an Advanced Class
Advanced classes are like basic classes, except that they have requirements that must be met before a character can attain 1st level in the class. A character who qualifies can choose an advanced class as an additional class as he or she gains levels, using the multiclassing rules. Some combination of base attack bonus, feats, and skill ranks determines whether a character is eligible to gain a level in an advanced class.

An Infiltrator knows how to size up an area and get the lay of the land in a single sweep of his or her eyes. This sweep provides a +4 circumstance bonus on Spot checks and covers an area out to 30 feet away from the Infiltrator. The Infiltrator can use this bonus at the start of an encounter.
Anything not concealed can be spotted in a sweep with a successful check (DC 10). The DC for concealed or less obvious threats is equal to their Hide check result.

For an Infiltrator who does not have evasion (see the Fast hero class description), improved evasion counts as evasion for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites on the Fast hero’s defensive talent tree.
Skill Mastery

Improved Sweep
At 8th level, an Infiltrator’s ability to get the lay of the land improves. Now the Infiltrator not only spots potential perils with a successful check, he or she can determine the relative strength of these dangers. A successful check relates the danger’s strength compared to the Infiltrator: stronger (higher level or Hit Dice), on par (same level or HD), or weaker (lower level or HD).
Without a Trace
At 10th level, when an Infiltrator uses any of the following skills: Balance, Climb, Disable Device, Escape Artist, Hide, Move Silently, and Sleight of Hand, those using Investigate, Listen, Search, or Spot to detect the Infiltrator’s activity take a –4 penalty.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Techie advanced class.
Jury-Rig
A Techie gains a +2 competence bonus on Repair skill checks made to attempt temporary or jury-rigged repairs. See the Repair skill for details on jury-rigging.
At 7th level, this competence bonus increases to +4.
Extreme Machine
If it has mechanical or electronic components, a Techie of 2nd level or higher can get maximum performance out of it.
By spending 1 action point and making either a Craft (electronic) or Craft (mechanical) check (whichever is appropriate for the machine in question), the Techie can temporarily improve a machine’s performance—at the risk of causing the machine to need repairs later. The DC for the Craft check depends on the type of improvement being made, as shown on the table below.

|Improvement|Craft DC|Repair Chance (d%)|
|-----------|--------|------------------|
|Ranged Weapons|
|+1 to damage|15|01–25|
|+2 to damage|20|01–50|
|+3 to damage|25|01–75|
|+5 ft. to range increment|15|01–25|
|+10 ft. to range increment|25|01–50|
|Electronic Devices|
|+1 equipment bonus|15|01–25|
|+2 equipment bonus|20|01–50|
|+3 equipment bonus|25|01–75|
|Vehicles|
|+1 on initiative checks|20|01–25|
|+1 to maneuver|25|01–50|
|+2 to maneuver|30|01–75|

The Techie performs the extreme modifications in 1 hour. The Techie can’t take 10 or take 20 on this check. If the check succeeds, the effect of the improvement lasts for a number of minutes equal to his or her Techie class level, beginning when the object is first put into use. The Techie selects the single improvement he or she wants to make prior to making the check. After the duration of the effect ends, the machine reverts to its previous state and a repair chance percentile roll is made. The result of this roll indicates whether the machine re-quires repairs before it can be used again.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Techie gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Techie must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Builder, Cautious, Combat Expertise, Educated, Gearhead, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Point Blank Shot, Studious.
Build Robot
A Techie of 4th level or higher can build remote-controlled robots that are Tiny or Diminutive in size. These robots serve as the Techie’s eyes, ears, or hands out to a predetermined distance away from the character when the Techie wants to use one of the following skills: Computer Use, Demolitions, Disable Device, Listen, Repair, or Spot.
The Techie must have at least 1 rank in the skill that he wants to program into the robot. The Techie can only control one robot at a time, and only one of his robots can be active at any time.
Follow these steps to build a robot.

Wealth Check: The purchase DC for the components needed to construct a robot is based on the robot’s size.

|Size|Purchase DC|
|:---|-----------|
|Diminutive|18|
|Tiny|15|

Make the Wealth check to purchase and gather the necessary components prior to starting construction.

Construct Frame: The robot’s body determines its size, shape, locomotion, and hit points. The DC of the Craft (mechanical) check is set by the robot’s size and modified by the form of locomotion selected.

|Size|Craft DC|
|:---|--------|
|Diminutive|15|
|Tiny|12|

|Components|DC Modifier|
|----------|-----------|
|Frame Shape and Locomotion\*|
|Bipedal|+4|
|Quadruped|+3|
|Treads|+2|
|Wheels|+1|
|External Components\*\*|
|Manipulators\*\*\*|+3|
|Audio/visual sensor|+2|
|Remote Range\*|
|Remote control link, 100 feet|+1|
|Remote control link, 200 feet|+3|
|Remote control link, 300 feet|+5|

\* Select only one of the options in this category.
\*\* Select one or more of the options in this category.
\*\*\* Necessary for a robot built to use any skill except Listen or Spot.

Select a frame size and form, add manipulators and sensors as necessary, and choose a type of remote control link. Add all the modifiers to determine the check’s DC. Make the Craft (mechanical) check to construct the robot’s frame.
It takes a Techie 30 hours to construct a Diminutive robot frame or 12 hours to construct a Tiny robot frame.
A Diminutive robot can be 6 to 12 inches long or tall and weighs about 1 pound. A Tiny robot can be 13 to 24 inches long or tall and weighs up to 3 pounds. Statistics for these robots can be found in the Creature listings.


Construct the Electronics: The next step is to build the internal electronics for the robot and install them in the frame. The DC is based on the size of the robot and modified by the number of components that need to be wired together. For a Diminutive robot, the DC is 20. For a Tiny robot, the DC is 15. Add +1 to the DC for each external component and +2 for the remote link. Make the Craft (electronic) check.
It takes a Techie 12 hours to wire a Diminutive robot or 6 hours to wire a Tiny robot.
Program the Robot: The Techie programs the robot as the final step. Decide how many ranks of the appropriate skill to program into the robot, up to the number of ranks the Techie has in the skill. A Techie’s robot can only contain programming for one skill. Make the Computer Use check to program the robot.
The DC for the Computer Use check is 20, modified by the number of ranks the Techie wants to program into the robot (+1 to the DC for each rank). It takes 1 hour to program the robot.
Reprogramming: A robot can be reprogrammed at any time. Doing this requires 1 hour of work and a Computer Use check (DC 20 + the number of ranks programmed into the robot).
Mastercraft
At 5th level, the Techie becomes adept at creating mastercraft objects. He of she applies the mastercraft ability to one of his or her Craft skills (electronic or mechanical). From this point on, he or she can build mastercraft objects using that skill.
With Craft (electronic), the Techie can build electronic devices. With Craft (mechanical), the Techie can build mechanical devices, including weapons.
On average, it takes twice as long to build a mastercraft object as it does to build an ordinary object of the same type. The cost to build a mastercraft object is equal to the purchase DC for the components (see the appropriate Craft skill description) + the bonus provided by the mastercraft feature. A Techie can add the mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary object by making the Wealth check and then making the Craft check as though he or she were constructing the object from scratch.
In addition to the Wealth check, the Techie must also pay a cost in experience points equal to 25 x his or her Techie level x the bonus provided by the mastercraft feature. The XP must be paid before making the Craft check. If the expenditure of these XP would drop the Techie to below the minimum needed for his or her current level, then the XP can’t be paid and the Techie can’t use the mastercraft ability until he or she gains enough additional XP to remain at his or her current level after the expenditure is made.
When successfully completed, a mastercraft object provides a +1 bonus to its quality compared to an ordinary object of the same type. All weapons and armor, and certain other types of equipment, such as computers and electronic devices, can be constructed as mastercraft objects.
At 8th level, the Techie can add the mastercraft ability to another Craft skill, or he or she can improve his or her ability in the skill selected at 5th level, so that his or her mastercraft objects provide a +2 bonus.
At 10th level, the Techie adds another +1 bonus to his or her mastercraft ability. If the Techie focuses his or her ability on one Craft skill, his or her mastercraft objects now provide a +3 bonus. If the Techie already has the ability for both Craft skills, he or she chooses which one to improve to a +2 bonus.
The Craft DC for a mastercraft object is the same as for a normal object of the same type, as described in the Craft skill, with the following modification: For a +1 object, add +3 to the Craft DC; for a +2 object, add +5 to the Craft DC; and for a +3 object, add +10 to the Craft DC.

|9th|+6|+3|+4|+4|Bonus feat|+5|+3|
|10th|+7|+3|+5|+5|Sixth sense|+5|+4|

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Investigator advanced class.
Profile
By making a Gather Information check (DC 15) when talking to witnesses of a crime, the Investigator compiles a rough mental picture of the suspect. This mental picture provides a physical description, including distinguishing markings and visible mannerisms. Success makes the profile accurate, at least concerning a particular suspect as seen by witnesses. (For this Gather Information check, no money changes hands.)
The Investigator can expand the profile by making an Investigate check (DC 15) involving the crime scene or other evidence linked to the suspect. If successful, the Investigator combines eyewitness accounts with forensic evidence to develop a profile of the suspect’s method of operation. This provides a +2 circumstance bonus on any skill checks made to uncover additional evidence or otherwise locate and capture the suspect.
Contact
An Investigator of 2nd level or higher cultivates associates and informants. Each time the Investigator gains a contact, the GM should develop a supporting character to represent the contact. The player can suggest the type of contact his or her character wants to gain, but the contact must be an ordinary character, not a heroic character.
A contact will not accompany an Investigator on missions or risk his or her life. A contact can, however, provide information or render a service (make a specific skill check on the Investigator’s behalf).
At 2nd level, the Investigator gains a low-level contact, at 5th level a mid-level contact, and at 8th level a high-level contact.
The Investigator can’t call on the same contact more than once in a week, and when he or she does call on a contact, compensation may be required for the assistance the contact renders. In general, a professional associate won’t be compensated monetarily, but instead will consider that the Investigator owes him or her a favor. Contacts with underworld or street connections usually demand monetary compensation for the services they render, and experts in the use of skills normally want to be paid for the services they provide.
For underworld or street contacts, this expense is represented by a Wealth check against a purchase DC of 10 for the low-level contact, 15 for the mid-level contact, or 20 for the high-level contact. For skilled experts, the purchase DC is 10 + the ranks the expert has in the appropriate skill.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Investigator gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Investigator must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Brawl, Defensive Martial Arts, Dodge, Double Tap, Educated, Knockout Punch, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Point Blank Shot.
Nonlethal Force
At 4th level, an Investigator becomes adept at using nonlethal force to subdue an opponent. From this point on, he or she can deal nonlethal damage with a weapon that normally deals lethal damage (if he or she so chooses) without taking the normal –4 penalty on the attack roll.
Discern Lie
At 7th level, an Investigator develops the ability to gauge whether another character is telling the truth by reading facial expressions and interpreting body language. The Investigator must be able to see and hear (but not necessarily understand) the individual under scrutiny.
With a successful Sense Motive check opposed by the subject’s Bluff check result or against DC 10 (whichever is greater), the Investigator can tell whether the subject is deliberately and knowingly speaking a lie. This ability doesn’t reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal omissions in information.
Sixth Sense
At 10th level, an Investigator becomes so attuned at solving mysteries that he or she finds a way to put two and two together and rarely misses a clue. Whenever the Investigator spends 1 action point to improve the result of a skill check made using certain skills (see below), the Investigator gets to add an additional 1d6 to the result.
The skills that sixth sense applies to are Gather Information, Investigate, Listen, Research, Search, and Spot.

PERSONALITY

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Personality advanced class.
Unlimited Access
When others would normally make a Diplomacy check or Bluff check to smooth-talk or trick their way into a private party or invitation-only event, the Personality adds a bonus equal to his or her Personality level.
When a Personality buys a ticket to a show or for transportation, he or she can make a Diplomacy check to get that ticket upgraded.  DCs are given below.

|Upgrade|Diplomacy DC|
|:------|:----------:|
|Seat at sporting event to field pass|10|
|Hotel room to suite|15|
|Concert or theater ticket to backstage pass|20|
|Economy transportation to first-class|25|

Bonus Class Skill
At 2nd and again at 7th level, the Personality designates one cross-class skill as a class skill. Once designated, the skill is considered a class skill every time the character adds a new level of Personality.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Personality gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Personality must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Alertness, Animal Affinity, Combat Expertise, Confident, Creative, Deceptive, Defensive Martial Arts, Educated, Trustworthy.
Royalty
At 4th and 8th level, a Personality’s activities in the public eye generate extra income. This income provides a Wealth bonus increase of +4.
Winning Smile
At 5th level, a Personality develops such a force of personal magnetism that he or she can convince a single target to regard him or her as a trusted friend. (If the target is currently being threatened or attacked by the Personality or his or her allies, this ability won’t work.)
The target makes a Will saving throw to avoid being persuaded by the Personality’s words and actions. The DC is 10 + Personality’s class level + Personality’s Charisma bonus.
This ability doesn’t enable the Personality to control the target, but the target perceives the Personality’s words and actions in the most favorable way. The Personality can try to give the target orders, but he or she must win an opposed Charisma check to convince the target to perform any actions the target wouldn’t normally undertake. The target never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, and any act by the Personality or his or her allies that threatens the target breaks the mood and clears the target’s head. Otherwise, a target remains won over for 1 minute per Personality level.
After the duration expires, the GM determines the reaction and attitude of the target based on what the Personality compelled the target to do.
This is a Mind-Affecting ability.
Compelling Performance
At 10th level, a Personality’s force of personal magnetism increases to the point that he or she can arouse a single emotion of his or her choice—despair, hope, or rage—in a target. To use this ability, the Personality must spend 1 action point. The emotion he or she arouses affects one target (a GM character) within 15 feet of the Personality (or within 15 feet of a television, radio, or telephone that broadcasts the Personality’s performance). The performance requires a full-round action, and its effects on the target last for 1d4+1 rounds.
The target makes a Will saving throw. The DC is 10 + Personality’s class level + Personality’s Charisma bonus. If the target succeeds at the saving throw, he or she is immune to the compulsion of this performance. If the target fails, he or she reacts to the emotion as described below.
Despair: The target takes a –2 morale penalty on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.
Hope: The target gains a +2 morale bonus on saving throws, attack rolls, ability checks, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls.
Rage: The target gains a +2 morale bonus to Strength and Constitution, a +1 morale bonus on Will saves, and a –1 penalty to Defense. In a dramatic situation, the target is compelled to fight, regardless of the danger.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Negotiator advanced class.
Conceal Motive
A Negotiator gets to add a bonus equal to his or her Negotiator level whenever he or she opposes a Sense Motive check.
React First
Starting at 2nd level, a Negotiator gains the ability to react first when trying to make a deal or mediate a settlement. The Negotiator must make contact and speak to the participants prior to the start of combat. If he or she does this, he or she gains a free readied action that allows the Negotiator to make either a move or attack action if either side in the negotiation (other than the Negotiator) decides to start hostilities. The Negotiator gets to act before any initiative checks are made, in effect giving him or her the benefit of surprise.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Negotiator gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Negotiator must meet all the prerequisites of the feat to select it.
Advanced Firearms Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Armor Proficiency (medium), Attentive, Confident, Dead Aim, Deceptive, Educated, Far Shot, Iron Will, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Trustworthy.
Talk Down
A Negotiator of 4th level or higher can talk his or her way out of trouble. Either prior to the start of hostilities or during combat, the Negotiator can talk down a single opponent within 15 feet of his or her position or otherwise able to hear the Negotiator’s voice. The target must be able to understand the Negotiator. That opponent immediately stops fighting and reverts to an indifferent attitude regarding the Negotiator and the situation in general. Any hostile action by the Negotiator or by one of the Negotiator’s allies directed at the opponent allows the opponent to act as he or she sees fit.
To initiate this talent, the Negotiator must spend a full-round action talking to his or her opponent. The opponent makes a Will saving throw. The DC is equal to 10 + Negotiator’s class level + Negotiator’s Charisma bonus. If the save fails, the opponent stops fighting. If the save succeeds, the opponent continues as normal.
At 7th level, a Negotiator can talk down a number of opponents equal to his or her Charisma bonus within 15 feet of his or her position or within 15 feet of a television, radio, or telephone broadcasting the Negotiator’s message.
At 10th level, the range extends to 30 feet and covers all opponents who can hear and understand the Negotiator’s voice.
This is a Mind-Affecting ability.
No Sweat
Starting at 5th level, whenever a Negotiator spends 1 action point to improve the result of a die roll, he or she rolls an additional 1d6. The Negotiator can then select the highest die roll to add to his or her d20 roll.
Sow Distrust
A Negotiator of 8th level or higher can turn one character against another. The Negotiator must spend a full-round action and know the name of the character he or she is attempting to persuade as well as the name of the character toward whom the target’s distrust will be directed. The target must be able to hear and understand the Negotiator.
The target makes a Will save. The DC is equal to 10 + Negotiator’s class level + Negotiator’s Charisma bonus. If the target fails the save, his or her attitude toward the other designated character worsens by one step: helpful turns to friendly, friendly to indifferent, indifferent to unfriendly, unfriendly to hostile (see the Diplomacy skill). The target makes a Will save whenever the Negotiator uses this talent against him or her. As long as the target continues to fail the Will save, the Negotiator can continue taking full-round actions to worsen the target’s attitude toward a designated character. When the target’s attitude drops to hostile, he or she attacks the designated character.
A successful Will save doesn’t restore previous attitude shifts, but it does render the target immune for 24 hours to further attempts by the Negotiator to sow distrust.
The Negotiator can’t use this talent on his or her allies.
This is a Mind-Affecting ability.
