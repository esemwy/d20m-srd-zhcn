# 技能 II

## 收集信息（魅）

**检定：** 经过一次成功的技能检定（DC10）并花费1d4+1小时来消费、吃喝，角色将知晓邻里间发生的大多数新闻。只能收集到那些没有必要藏着掖着的信息。检定结果越高，信息就越准确。

若信息不需要花钱购买，就没必要进行财富检定。

从传闻到受保护的信息，信息的费用和DC也根据信息的类型逐步升高，详见下表。

|信息类型|DC|购买DC|
|------------------|:-:|:---------:|
|传闻|10|5|
|专门|15|10|
|受限|20|15|
|受保护|25|20|

传闻就是当地发生的事、谣言、绯闻等等。专门的信息通常要带目的地去寻求才能得到。受限的信息包括并非众所周知的信息，需要从能接触到这个信息的人身上获得。受保护的信息更难获得，获得此信息会让问者或答者陷入危险。获取受限或受保护信息的行为有可能会被人记下来。

角色可以增加收集信息所花费的金钱，以获得等效于贿赂的情景加值（这个过程可以体现为买更贵的饮料，而不是一定要另外给一笔钱）。角色每为收集信息检定增加1点情景加值，所需的财富检定DC+2。

**重试：** 可以，但每次检定要间隔1d4+1小时，而且如果重复追问某一类特定信息，你也许会引起注意。

**特别：** 角色可以在收集信息检定中取10， 但不能取20。

有`值得信赖`专长的角色的收集信息检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 收集信息检定需要1d4+1小时。

## 驯养动物（魅） 需受训

**检定：** 生效所需时间和检定DC取决于角色试图要做到什么。

|任务|时间|DC|
|----|---|:-:|
|驾驭动物|移动动作|10|
|逼迫动物|整轮动作|25|
|教会动物一个技巧|1周|见下文|
|为通用工作训练动物|见下文|见下文|

**驾驭动物：** 指的是命令一只动物完成一项它所会的工作或技巧。如果动物受伤或者受到任何属性伤害，DC+5。如果检定成功，动物的下一个动作就是完成这个工作或技巧。

**逼迫动物：** 逼迫动物指的是让动物完成它还不会，但有能力办到的工作或技巧。如果检定成功，动物的下一个动作就是完成这个工作或技巧。

**教会动物一个技巧：** 角色可以用一次成功的驯养动物检定和一周的时间教会动物一个特定的技巧，比如“攻击”或者“停留”。有1点智力的动物可以学习至多3个技巧，而有2点智力的动物可以学习至多6个技巧

角色可以教会动物只听自己的命令。其他人试图让动物完成技巧所做的驯养动物检定将受到10点减值。教会动物只听自己的指令算作一个技巧（算在动物已学技巧数里）。这不需要检定，但是这会让所有教会动物技巧的DC+5。如果动物已经学会任何技巧，角色不能再教会动物只听自己的指令。

可学的技巧包括但不限于：

**攻击（DC20）：** 动物攻击可见敌人。角色指着一个目标让动物攻击。一般来说，动物只攻击人类和其他动物。教会动物攻击所有生物（包括超自然生物比如战斗中出现的不死生物类和异怪类）算两个技巧。

**过来（DC15）：** 动物会靠近角色，即使动物一般不会这么做（比如跟随角色上船）。

**防御（DC20）：** 动物会为角色防御（或者在角色没有威胁时准备防御）。或者角色可以命令动物为制定的其他角色提供防御。

**退让（DC15）：** 让动物脱离战斗。

**取物（DC15）：** 让动物过去拿一些东西。角色应该指向特定的物品，否则动物会随机拿些物品。

**看守（DC20）** 让动物待在一个地方阻止其他生物靠近。

**跟随（DC15）** 让动物紧跟着角色，即使是跟着去平常不会去的地方。

**表演（DC15）：** 让动物表演一些简单的把戏，比如坐下、打滚等等。

**搜寻（DC15）：** 让动物进入一个区域搜寻它感兴趣的物品。一旦找到则停止搜寻。让一个动物感兴趣的物品多种多样。动物总是优先找感兴趣的人或生物。要让动物理解这是一个搜寻特定物品的指令，必须让动物做一次智力检定（DC10）。

**停留（DC15）** 让动物待在一个地方等待角色回来。它不会挑战经过的其他生物，但他仍然会在必要时自我防御。

**追踪（DC20）** 让动物追踪让它嗅到的气味。

**劳作（DC15）：** 让动物拉推中等或重度负载。

**（为通用工作）训练动物：** 角色可以为训练动物做一些通用的`工作`，而不只是训练一些简单的`技巧`。本质上，一项动物的`工作`代表了一系列已知`技巧`的集合，可用于相似的用途。一个动物只能学会一种`工作`，但是如果动物还有余力学习其他`技巧`（不在通用工作里的技巧）则仍可以学习。为通用工作训练动物需要的检定比教会动物单独的技巧少。

**战斗骑乘（DC20，6周）：** 被训练为战斗中驮骑手的动物懂得攻击、过来、防御、退让、看守、跟随。可将已训练`骑乘`的动物“升级”至战斗骑乘，这需要3周时间进行驯养动物检定（DC20）。如果动物还训练了其他技巧（骑乘工作之外的技巧），这些技巧将被完全替换为战斗骑乘工作的技巧。

**战斗（DC20，3周）：** 为战斗而训练的动物懂得攻击，退让，还有停留。

**守护（DC20，4周）：** 为护卫而训练的动物懂得攻击，防御，退让，还有看守。

**干重活（DC15，2周）：** 为重活而训练的动物知道过来和劳作。

**捕猎（DC20，6周）：** 为捕猎而训练的动物懂得攻击，退让，取物，跟随，搜寻，以及追踪。

**表演（DC15， 4周）：** 为表演而训练的动物懂得过来，取物，跟随，表演，以及停留。

**骑乘（DC15，3周）：** 为骑乘而训练的动物懂得过来，跟随，以及停留。动物

**重试：** 可以。

**特别：** 角色驯养动物可以取10取20。

未受训角色使用魅力检定来驾驭和逼迫动物，但不能教会动物技巧或工作。

有`动物亲和`专长且此技能至少1级的角色，驯养动物检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 见上文。教会技巧或训练工作都要花费数以天计的时间。角色不需要把所有时间都花在驯养动物上面，每天3小时就够了。（每天训练超过3小时也不会减少训练所需天数。）训练的日期不能分开，如果训练的日期不能连贯，就前功尽弃了。

## 躲藏（敏） 护甲减值

**检定：** 角色用躲藏检定与任何可能看得到角色的人的侦察检定对抗。角色躲藏时可以以半速移动而不受惩罚。角色的速度大于半速，躲藏检定将受到5点减值。攻击、奔跑或冲锋时躲藏是几乎不可能的（有20减值）。

**躲藏检定同样受到角色体型调整值影响：**

|体型|调整值|体型|调整值|
|----|:------:|----|:------:|
|超微型|+16|大型|–4|
|微型|+12|超大型|–8|
|超小型|+8|巨型|–12|
|小型|+4|超巨型|–16|
|普通|+0|||

如果有人注视着角色，即使不是刻意注视，角色就不能躲藏。角色可以绕到角落里脱离视线以便躲藏，但其他人至少还是知道角色的去向的。

掩体和隐蔽会为躲藏提供情景加值，见下文。注意角色如果处于一半以下的掩体或隐蔽则不可躲藏。

|掩体或隐蔽|情景加值|
|--------------------|:----------------:|
|四分之三|+5|
|十分之九|+10|

**转移注意力以躲藏：** 角色可以使用唬骗帮助自己躲藏。一次成功的唬骗检定可让角色分散搜捕者的注意力一小会，让自己此时可以做一次躲藏检定。当他人的注意力从角色的身上移开，且角色在可以躲藏的位置，角色可以进行一次躲藏检定。（通常这么规定，躲藏的位置必须在半径为n尺的范围内，n等于角色躲藏等级。）但这个检定会有10点减值，因为角色必须快速移动到躲藏的位置。

**尾随：** 角色可以适用躲藏来在公共场合尾随一个人。以这种形式使用此技能的情形是假设附近随机分布着几个人，用躲藏来混入其中而不被注意。如果目标担心被跟踪，可以在每次切换地域（转过一个街角、离开建筑等等）时进行一次侦察检定（与角色的躲藏检定对抗）。若目标没有疑心，则通常只在尾随的1小时后进行一次侦察检定。

**特别：** 角色可以在躲藏检定中取10， 但不能取20。

有`隐秘`专长的角色的躲藏检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 躲藏检定是一个攻击动作。

## 威吓（魅）

**检定：** 检定成功时，角色可以强行说服另一个角色完成一些工作或者做指定的举动。角色的威吓检定是与目标的等级检定（1d20+目标的角色等级或生命骰）对抗。目标所有的任何适用于其意志检定的调整值将应用与此等级检定。若角色成功，则视为目标对其友善，持续10分钟，但这种友善只体现在对方做所要求做的事上，且角色必须一直在场。（也就是说，目标保留原来的态度，但在威吓下会聊天、建议、提供有限的帮助、或为角色辩护。）

DM应根据情境调整威吓检定的效果使其更合理。

成功的威吓检定能做的事也有限制。

角色不能强迫他人服从自己的每一个命令，或者做一些危及目标生命的事。

如果角色失败5点以上，目标会做与角色期望正相反的事。

**重试：** 不行。即使首次检定成功了，对方也只能被威吓到一种程度，重试是没用的。如果首次检定失败，对方会更坚定地抗拒威吓，重试也是没用的。

**特别：** 角色可以在威吓检定中取10， 但不能取20。

免疫恐惧的角色不会被威吓到。

角色的体型每比目标大一级，威吓检定就多2点加值。相反地，角色每比目标小一级，威吓检定就多2点减值。

有`自信`专长的角色在威吓检定以及对抗威吓的等级检定上获得2点加值。

**时间：** 威吓检定是一个整轮动作。

## 调查（智） 需受训

**检定：** 角色一般用搜索发现线索，用调査分析线索。角色在技术鉴定室里，应使用调查技能来收集和准备实验样本。调查检定的结果为鉴定室工作人员的工作提供加值或减值。

**分析线索：** 角色可以做一次调查检定来对线索进行法医学鉴定。这种形式的调查不能凭空给角色提供新的线索。只是简单地让角色从已发现的线索推演出更多信息。

分析线索的基础DC是15。DC受线索的留存时间和现场的破坏影响。

|情景|DC 调整值|
|-------------|:---------:|
|事发每过一天（最大调整值为+10）|+2|
|现场在户外|+5|
|现场被轻度破坏|+2|
|现场被中度破坏|+4|
|现场被重度破坏|+6|

**收集证据：** 角色可以为技术鉴定室收集并提供物证。这种形式的调查需要取证工具。

收集一份证据需要进行一次调查检定（DC15）。若检定成功，该证据则可用于技术鉴定室分析。若检定失败，技术鉴定室也能分析，但会在任何分析所需的检定上受到5点减值。若检定失败5点及以上，则无法分析。反之，如果检定成功10点及以上，技术鉴定室对此物证的所有分析检定都有2点情景加值。

这种形式的调查不能凭空给角色提供物品。这只是一个收纳已发现物品的检定，成功收纳以帮助技术鉴定室分析。

**重试：** 一般来说，再次分析不会得出新结论，除非发现了新的线索。收集了的证据不能再收集，除非有多个可供收集。

**特别：** 角色可以在调查检定中取10， 但不能取20。

收集证据需要取证工具。如果角色没有合适的工具，检定时要受4点减值。

有`听者有心`专长且此技能至少1级的角色，调查检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 分析线索是一个整轮动作。收集证据每一件通常需要1d4分钟。

## 跳跃（力） 护甲减值

**检定：** DC与能跳跃的距离取决于角色以何种方式跳跃。

角色的跳跃检定要加上速度的调整值。下列DC假定角色有30尺的速度（人类的标准速度）。若角色速度低于30尺，每比30尺低10尺都要受到6点减值。若角色速度高于30尺，每比30尺多10尺都要受到4点加值。

若角色跳跃至少1级并成功跳跃，角色可以脚着地（如果合适），并且可以以剩下可移动距离继续移动。若角色的跳跃是未受训的，检定成功角色将俯卧着地，除非成功5点及以上。从俯卧状态爬起是一个移动动作。

一轮内跳跃所移动的距离将受限于最高移动距离。角色可以在回合结束时起跳，在下一回合完成跳跃。

**跳远：** 水平的跳跃，以跨越峡谷或溪流之类的沟壑。在跳跃的中点，角色达到最高位，高度等于水平距离的四分之一。跳跃DC等于欲跳跃的距离（以尺计）。5到30尺的跳远的DC如下表。角色不能跳出大于其常速的距离。

所有跳跃DC假定的前提条件是角色在跳之前至少有20尺的助跑距离。如果条件未满足，DC加倍。

|跳远距离|DC\*|跳远距离|DC\*|
|------------------|:--:|------------------|:--:|
|5 尺|5|20 尺|20|
|10 尺|10|25 尺|25|
|15 尺|15|30 尺|30|

\* 需要先移动20尺。若不够20尺，DC加倍。

若角色检定失败不足5点，将无法跳到目的地，但可以做一个反射检定（DC15）来抓住壕沟的边缘。角色抓住边缘时将结束移动。如果角色因此悬挂在峡谷或壕沟边缘，爬上来需要一个移动动作来进行一次攀爬检定（DC15）。

**跳高：** 垂直的跳跃，以抓住高于头顶的攀爬点，比如爬树或岩脊。跳跃的DC等于高度×4（以尺计）。1到8尺的跳高DC如下表。

所有跳跃DC假定的前提条件是角色在跳之前至少有20尺的助跑距离。如果条件未满足，DC加倍。

|跳高距离|DC\*|跳高距离|DC\*|
|------------------|:--:|------------------|:--:|
|1 尺|4|5 尺|20|
|2 尺|8|6 尺|24|
|3 尺|12|7 尺|28|
|4 尺|16|8 尺|32|

\* 需要先移动20尺。未助跑则DC加倍。

若角色检定成功，则可到达指定高度。角色将抓稳目的地的物体。如果角色要爬上来，则需要一个移动动作来进行一次攀爬检定（DC15）。若跳跃检定失败，角色无法达到指定高度，将以脚着地落回起跳的方格。

跳跃到指定高度的难度也取决于角色或生物的体型。生物通常无需跳跃就能达到的高度见下表。（作为中等体型的生物，普通的人类能不靠跳跃攀上8尺高的地方。）如果生物是长而不是高，等效体型要降低一级。

|生物体型|最大高度|
|-------------|--------------|
|超巨型|128 尺|
|巨型|64 尺|
|超大型|32 尺|
|大型|16 尺|
|普通|8 尺|
|小型|4 尺|
|超小型|2 尺|
|微型|1 尺|
|超微型|0.5 尺|

**跳台阶：** 角色能用跳跃检定跳上与其腰等高的目标上（DC10）。这么做相当于一个10尺的移动。跳台阶无需助跑（未助跑DC不加倍）。

**跳下：** 角色从高处跳下承受的伤害比单纯的坠落要低。从高处跳下的DC为15。跳下无需助跑（未助跑DC不加倍）。

若检定成功，角色的坠落伤害等效于从跳跃高度-10尺处坠落。

**特别：** 增加角色速度的效果同样会增加角色的跳跃距离，因为检定受角色的速度影响。

跳跃检定可取10。若失败结果没有危险，可取20。

有`杂技`专长的角色的跳跃检定有2点加值。若有20尺助跑，有奔跑专长的角色还会为跳跃提供2点表现加值。

翻滚会为跳跃检定提供2点共效加值（见`技能共效`）。

**时间：** 使用跳跃技能是移动动作或整轮动作，取决于角色是以一个移动动作还是一个整轮动作完成整个跳跃过程。

## Knowledge (Int) Trained Only

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill. These categories are identified and defined below.

The number of Knowledge categories is kept purposely finite. When trying to determine what Knowledge skill a particular question or field of expertise falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. Do not arbitrarily make up new categories.

**Check:** A character makes a Knowledge check to see if the character knows something.

The DC for answering a question within the character’s field of study is 10 for easy questions, 15 for basic questions, and 20 to 30 for tough questions.

Appraising the value of an object is one sort of task that can be performed using Knowledge. The DC depends on how common or obscure the object is. On a success, the character accurately identifies the object’s purchase DC. If the character fails, he or she thinks it has a purchase DC 1d2 higher or lower (determine randomly) than its actual value. If the character fails by 5 or more, he or she thinks it has a purchase DC 1d4+2 higher or lower than its actual value. The GM may make the Knowledge roll for the character, so he or she doesn’t  know whether the appraisal is accurate or not.

The fourteen Knowledge categories, and the topics each one encompasses, are as follows.

**Arcane Lore:** The occult, magic and the supernatural, astrology, numerology, and similar topics.

**Art:** Fine arts and graphic arts, including art history and artistic techniques. Antiques, modern art, photography, and performance art forms such as music and dance, among others.

**Behavioral Sciences:** Psychology, sociology, and criminology.

**Business:** Business procedures, investment strategies, and corporate structures. Bureaucratic procedures and how to navigate them.

**Civics:** Law, legislation, litigation, and legal rights and obligations. Political and governmental institutions and processes.

**Current Events:** Recent happenings in the news, sports, politics, entertainment, and foreign affairs.

**Earth and Life Sciences:** Biology, botany, genetics, geology, and paleontology. Medicine and forensics.

**History:** Events, personalities, and cultures of the past. Archaeology and antiquities.

**Physical Sciences:** Astronomy, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and engineering.

**Popular Culture:** Popular music and personalities, genre films and books, urban legends, comics, science fiction, and gaming, among others.

**Streetwise:** Street and urban culture, local underworld personalities and events.

**Tactics:** Techniques and strategies for disposing and maneuvering forces in combat.

**Technology:** Current developments in cutting-edge devices, as well as the background necessary to identify various technological devices.

**Theology and Philosophy:** Liberal arts, ethics, philosophical concepts, and the study of religious faith, practice, and experience.

**重试：** 不行。The check represents what a character knows, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let the character know something he or she never knew in the first place.

**Special:** An untrained Knowledge check is simply an Intelligence check. Without actual training, a character only knows common knowledge about a given subject.

A character can take 10 when making a Knowledge check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Educated feat gets a +2 bonus on any two types of Knowledge checks.

The GM may decide that having 5 or more ranks in a specific Knowledge skill provides a character with a +2 synergy bonus when making a related skill check.

**Time:** A Knowledge check can be a reaction, but otherwise requires a full-round action.

## Listen (Wis)

**Check:** Make a Listen check against a DC that reflects how quiet the noise is that a character might hear or against an opposed Move Silently check.

The GM may call for a Listen check by a character who is in a position to hear something. A character can also make a Listen check voluntarily if he or she wants to try to hear something in the character’s vicinity.

The GM may make the Listen check in secret so that the character doesn’t know whether not hearing anything means that nothing is there or that the character failed the check.

A successful Listen check when there isn’t anything to hear results in the character hearing nothing.

|DC|Sound|
|:-:|----|
|–20|Gunfire|
|–10|A melee battle|
|0|People talking|
|5|A person in medium armor walking at a slow pace, trying not to make noise|
|10|An unarmored person walking at a slow pace, trying not to make any noise|
|15|A 1st-level Fast hero sneaking up on someone\*|
|20|A tiger stalking prey\*|
|30|A bird flying through the air|
|+5|Through a door|
|+15|Through a solid wall|

\* This is actually an opposed check; the DC given is a typical Move Silently check result for such a character or creature.

|Condition|Check Penalty|
|---------|-------------|
|Per 10 feet of distance|–1|
|Listener distracted|–5|

**Try Again?:** A character can make a Listen check every time he or she has the opportunity to hear something in a reactive manner. As a move action, the character may attempt to hear something that he or she failed (or believes he or she failed) to hear previously.

**Special:** When several characters are listening to the same thing, the GM can make a single 1d20 roll and use it for all the listeners’ skill checks.

A character can take 10 or take 20 when making a Listen check. Taking 20 means the character spends 1 minute attempting to hear something that may or may not be there to hear.

A character with the Alertness feat gets a +2 bonus on all Listen checks.

A sleeping character can make Listen checks, but takes a –10 penalty on the checks.

**Time:** A Listen check is either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a move action (if a character actively takes the time to try to hear something).

## Move Silently (Dex) Armor Penalty

**Check:** A character’s Move Silently check is opposed by the Listen check of anyone who might hear the character. A character can move up to half his or her normal speed at no penalty. At more than half speed and up to the character’s full speed, he or she takes a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20 penalty) to move silently while attacking, running, or charging.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Move Silently check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Stealthy feat gets a +2 bonus on all Move Silently checks.

**Time:** Move Silently is a move action.

## Navigate (Int)

**Check:** Make a Navigate check when a character is trying to find his or her way to a distant location without directions or other specific guidance. Generally, a character does not need to make a check to find a local street or other common urban site, or to follow an accurate map. However, the character might make a check to wend his or her way through a dense forest or a labyrinth of underground storm drains.

For movement over a great distance, make a Navigate check. The DC depends on the length of the trip. If the character succeeds, he or she moves via the best reasonable course toward his or her goal. If the character fails, he or she still reaches the goal, but it takes the character twice as long (the character loses time backtracking and correcting his or her path). If the character fails by more than 5, the or she travels the expected time, but only gets halfway to his or her destination, at which point the character becomes lost.

A character may make a second Navigate check (DC 20) to regain his or her path. If the character succeeds, he or she continues on to his or her destination; the total time for the trip is twice the normal time. If the character fails, he or she loses half a day before the character can try again. The character keeps trying until he or she succeeds, losing half a day for each failure.

|Length of Trip|DC|
|-------------|:-:|
|Short (a few hours)|20|
|Moderate (a day or two)|22|
|Long (up to a week)|25|
|Extreme (more than a week)|28|

When faced with multiple choices, such as at a branch in a tunnel, a character can make a Navigate check (DC 20) to intuit the choice that takes the character toward a known destination.  If unsuccessful, the character chooses the wrong path, but at the next juncture, with a successful check, the character realizes his or her mistake.

A character cannot use this function of Navigate to find a path to a site if the character has no idea where the site is located. The GM may choose to make the Navigate check for the character in secret, so he or she doesn’t know from the result whether the character is following the right or wrong path.

A character can use Navigate to determine his or her position on earth without the use of any high-tech equipment by checking the constellations or other natural landmarks. The character must have a clear view of the night sky to make this check. The DC is 15.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Navigate check. A character can take 20 only when determining his or her location, not when traveling.

A character with the Guide feat gets a +2 bonus on all Navigate checks.

**Time:** A Navigate check is a full-round action.

## Perform (Cha)

This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill. These categories are identified and defined below.

The number of Perform categories is kept purposely finite. When trying to determine what Perform skill a particular type of performance falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. Do not arbitrarily make up new categories.

**Check:** The character is accomplished in some type of artistic expression and knows how to put on a performance. The character can impress audiences with his or her talent and skill. The quality of the character’s performance depends on his or her check result.

The eight Perform categories, and the qualities each one encompasses, are as follows.

**Act:** The character is a gifted actor, capable of performing drama, comedy, or action-oriented roles with some level of skill.

**Dance:** The character is a gifted dancer, capable of performing rhythmic and patterned bodily movements to music.

**Keyboards:** The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing keyboard musical instruments, such as piano, organ, and synthesizer.

**Percussion Instruments:** The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing percussion musical instruments, such as drums, cymbals, triangle, xylophone, and tambourine.

**Sing:** The character is a musician gifted with a talent for producing musical tones with your voice.

**Stand-Up:** The character is a gifted comedian, capable of performing a stand-up routine before an audience.

**Stringed Instruments:** The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing stringed musical instruments, such as banjo, guitar, harp, lute, sitar, and violin.

**Wind Instruments:** The character is a musician gifted with a talent for playing wind musical instruments, such as flute, bugle, trumpet, tuba, bagpipes, and trombone.

|Result|Performance|
|:----:|-----------|
|10|Amateur performance. Audience may appreciate your performance, but isn’t impressed.|
|15|Routine performance. Audience enjoys your performance, but it isn’t exceptional.|
|20|Great performance. Audience highly impressed.|
|25|Memorable performance. Audience enthusiastic.|
|30|Masterful performance. Audience awed.|

**Try Again?:** Not for the same performance and audience.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Perform check, but can’t take 20.

A character without an appropriate instrument automatically fails any Perform (keyboard), Perform (percussion), Perform (stringed), or Perform (wind) check he or she attempts. At the GM’s discretion, impromptu instruments may be employed, but the performer must take a –4 penalty on the check because his or her equipment, although usable, is inappropriate for the skill.

Every time a character takes the Creative feat, he or she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving two Perform skills the character designates. See the feat description for more information.

**Time:** A Perform check usually requires at least several minutes to an hour or more.

## Pilot (Dex) Trained Only

**Check:** Typical piloting tasks don’t require checks. Checks are required during combat, for special maneuvers, or in other extreme circumstances, or when the pilot wants to attempt something outside the normal parameters of the vehicle. When flying, the character can attempt simple maneuvers and stunts (actions in which the pilot attempts to do something complex very quickly or in a limited space).

Each vehicle’s description includes a maneuver modifier that applies to Pilot checks made by the operator of the vehicle.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Pilot check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Vehicle Expert feat gets a +2 bonus on all Pilot checks.

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose fixed-wing aircraft. Other types of aircraft (heavy aircraft, helicopters, jet fighters, and spacecraft) require the corresponding Aircraft Operation feat, or else the character takes a –4 penalty on Pilot checks.

**Time:** A Pilot check is a move action.

## Profession (Wis)

**Check:** A character makes Profession checks to improve his or her Wealth bonus every time he or she attains a new level. The DC for the check is the character’s current Wealth bonus. If the character succeeds at the Profession check, his or her Wealth bonus increases by +1. For every 5 by which the character exceeds the DC, his or her Wealth bonus increases by an additional +1. A character can’t take 10 or take 20 when making a Profession check to improve his or her Wealth bonus.

How many ranks a character has in the Profession skill (including ranks the character may have just acquired after gaining a level) also adds to the Wealth bonus increase the character receives upon gaining a new level. In addition to the Wealth bonus increase a character gains from your Profession check result (if the check succeeds), the number of ranks the character has in this skill increases his or her Wealth bonus as follows.

|Ranks|Wealth Bonus Increase|
|:---:|:-------------------:|
|1–5|+1|
|6–10|+2|
|11–15|+3|
|16–20|+4|
|21–23|+5|

**Special:** If the Gamemaster deems it appropriate, a character can add his or her Profession modifier when making a Reputation check to deal with a work- or career-related situation.

Every time a character takes the Windfall feat, he or she gets a cumulative +1 bonus on all Profession checks.

## Read/Write Language (None) Trained Only

The Read/Write Language skill doesn’t work like a standard skill.

* A character automatically knows how to read and write his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
* Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Read/Write Language, he or she chooses a new language that the character can read and write.
* A character never makes Read/Write Language checks. A character either knows how to read and write a specific language or doesn’t.
* To be able to speak a language that the character can read and write, he or she must take the Speak Language skill for the appropriate language.
* A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See below for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character can’t learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.

### Language Groups

There are thousands of languages to choose from when a character buys ranks in Speak Language or Read/Write Language. A few are listed here, sorted into their general language groups.

A language’s group doesn’t matter when a character is buying ranks in Speak Language or Read/Write Language. Language groups are provided because they pertain to the Smart hero’s Linguist talent.

This list is by no means exhaustive—there are many more language groups, and most groups contain more languages than those listed here.

**Algic:** Algonkin, Arapaho, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Shawnee.

**Armenian:** Armenian.

**Athabascan:** Apache, Chipewyan, Navaho.

**Attic:** Ancient Greek\*, Greek.

**Baltic:** Latvian, Lithuanian.

**Celtic:** Gaelic (Irish), Gaelic (Scots), Welsh.

**Chinese:** Cantonese, Mandarin.

**Finno-Lappic:** Estonian, Finnish, Lapp.

**Germanic:** Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Flemish, German, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish, Yiddish.

**Hamo-Semitic:** Coptic\*, Middle Egyptian\*.

**Indic:** Hindi, Punjabi, Sanskrit\*, Urdu.

**Iranian:** Farsi, Pashto.

**Japanese:** Japanese.

**Korean:** Korean.

**Romance:** French, Italian, Latin\*, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish.

**Semitic:** Akkadian (aka Babylonian)\*, Ancient Hebrew\*, Arabic, Aramaic\*, Hebrew.

**Slavic:** Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovak, Ukrainian.

**Tibeto-Burman:** Burmese, Sherpa, Tibetan.

**Turkic:** Azerbaijani, Turkish, Uzbek.

**Ugric:** Hungarian (aka Magyar).

\*This is an ancient language. In the modern world it is spoken only by scholars, or in some cases by small populations in isolated corners of the world.

## Repair (Int) Trained Only

**Check:** Most Repair checks are made to fix complex electronic or mechanical devices. The DC is set by the GM. In general, simple repairs have a DC of 10 to 15 and require no more than a few minutes to accomplish. More complex repair work has a DC of 20 or higher and can require an hour or more to complete. Making repairs also involves a monetary cost when spare parts or new components are needed, represented by a Wealth check. If the GM decides this isn’t necessary for the type of repair the character is attempting, then no Wealth check is needed.

|Repair Task (Example)|Purchase DC|Repair DC|Time|
|---------------------|:---------:|:-------:|:--:|
|Simple (tool, simple weapon)|4|10|1 min.|
|Moderate (mechanical or electronic component)|7|15|10 min.|
|Complex (mechanical or electronic device)|10|20|1 hr.|
|Advanced (cutting-edge mechanical or electronic device)|13|25|10 hr.|

**Jury-Rig:** A character can choose to attempt jury-rigged, or temporary, repairs. Doing this reduces the purchase DC by 3 and the Repair check DC by 5, and allows the character to make the checks in as little as a full-round action. However, a jury-rigged repair can only fix a single problem with a check, and the temporary repair only lasts until the end of the current scene or encounter. The jury-rigged object must be fully repaired thereafter.

A character can also use jury-rig to hot-wire a car or jump-start an engine or electronic device. The DC for this is at least 15, and it can be higher depending on the presence of security devices.

The jury-rig application of the Repair skill can be used untrained.

**Try Again?:** Yes, though in some specific cases, the GM may decide that a failed Repair check has negative ramifications that prevent repeated checks.

**Special:** A character can take 10 or take 20 on a Repair check. When making a Repair check to accomplish a jury-rig repair, a character can’t take 20.

Repair requires an electrical tool kit, a mechanical tool kit, or a multipurpose tool, depending on the task. If the character do not have the appropriate tools, he or she takes a –4 penalty on the check.

Craft (mechanical) or Craft (electronic) can provide a +2 synergy bonus on Repair checks made for mechanical or electronic devices (see Skill Synergy).

A character with the Gearhead feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Repair checks.

**Time:** See the table for guidelines. A character can make a jury-rig repair as a full-round action, but the work only lasts until the end of the current encounter.

## Research (Int)

**Check:** Researching a topic takes time, skill, and some luck. The GM determines how obscure a particular topic is (the more obscure, the higher the DC) and what kind of information might be available depending on where the character is conducting his or her research.

Information ranges from general to protected. Given enough time (usually 1d4 hours) and a successful skill check, the character gets a general idea about a given topic. This assumes that no obvious reasons exist why such information would be unavailable, and that the character has a way to acquire restricted or protected information.

The higher the check result, the better and more complete the information. If the character wants to discover a specific fact, date, map, or similar bit of information, add +5 to +15 to the DC.

**重试：** 可以。

**Special:** A character can take 10 or take 20 on a Research check.

A character with the Studious feat gets a +2 bonus on all Research checks.

Computer Use can provide a +2 synergy bonus on a Research check when searching computer records for data (see Skill Synergy).

**Time:** A Research check takes 1d4 hours.

## Ride (Dex)

Animals ill suited as mounts provide a –2 penalty on their rider’s Ride check.

**Check:** Typical riding actions don’t require checks. A character can saddle, mount, ride, and dismount without a problem. Mounting or dismounting an animal is a move action. Some tasks, such as those undertaken in combat or other extreme circumstances, require checks. In addition, attempting trick riding or asking the animal to perform an unusual technique also requires a check.

**Guide with Knees (DC 5):** The character can react instantly to guide his or her mount with his or her knees so that the character can use both hands in combat or to perform some other action. Make the check at the start of the character’s round. If the character fails, he or she can only use one hand this round because the character needs to use the other to control his or her mount.

**Stay in Saddle (DC 5):** The character can react instantly to try to avoid falling when his or her mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when the character takes damage.

**Fight while Mounted (DC 20):** While in combat, the character can attempt to control a mount that is not trained in combat riding (see the Handle Animal skill). If the character succeeds, he or she uses only a move action, and the character can use his or her attack action to do something else. If the character fails, he or she can do nothing else that round. If the character fails by more than 5, he or she loses control of the animal.

For animals trained in combat riding, the character does not need to make this check. Instead, the character can use his or her move action to have the animal perform a trick (commonly, to attack). The character can use his or her attack action normally.

**Cover (DC 15):** The character can react instantly to drop down and hang alongside his or her mount, using it as one-half cover. The character can’t attack while using his or her mount as cover. If the character fails, he or she doesn’t get the cover benefit.

**Soft Fall (DC 15):** The character reacts instantly when he or she falls off a mount, such as when it is killed or when it falls, to try to avoid taking damage. If the character fails, he or she takes 1d6 points of falling damage.

**Leap (DC 15):** The character can get his or her mount to leap obstacles as part of its movement. Use the character’s Ride modifier or the mount’s Jump modifier (whichever is lower) when the mount makes its Jump check (see the Jump skill). The character makes a Ride check (DC 15) to stay on the mount when it leaps.

**Fast Mount or Dismount (DC 20; armor penalty applies):** The character can mount or dismount as a free action. If the character fails the check, mounting or dismounting is a move action. (A character can’t attempt a fast mount or dismount unless he or she can perform the mount or dismount as a move action this round, should the check fail.)

**Special:** If the character is riding bareback, he or she takes a –5 penalty on Ride checks.

A character can take 10 when making a Ride check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Animal Affinity feat gets a +2 bonus on all Ride checks.

**Time:** Ride is a move action, except when otherwise noted for the special tasks listed above.

## Search (Int)

**Check:** The character generally must be within 10 feet of the object or surface to be examined. A character can examine up to a 5-foot-by-5-foot area or a volume of goods 5 feet on a side with a single check.

A Search check can turn up individual footprints, but does not allow a character to follow tracks or tell the character which direction the creature or creatures went or came from.

|DC|Task|
|:-:|---|
|10|Ransack an area to find a certain object.|
|20|Notice a typical secret compartment, a simple trap, or an obscure clue.|
|25+|Find a complex or well-hidden secret compartment or trap; notice an extremely obscure clue.|

**Special:** A character can take 10 or take 20 when making a Search check.

A character with the Meticulous feat gets a +2 bonus on all Search checks.

**Time:** A Search check is a full-round action.

## Sense Motive (Wis)
**Check:** A successful check allows the character to avoid being bluffed (see the Bluff skill). Sense Motive does not, however, allow a character to determine whether a given statement is a lie. The character can also use the skill to tell when someone is behaving oddly or to assess someone’s trustworthiness. In addition, a character can use this skill to make an assessment of a social situation. With a successful check (DC 20), the character can get the feeling from another’s behavior that something is wrong. Also, the character can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy and honorable.

**Try Again?:** No, though the character may make a Sense Motive check for each bluff made on the character.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Sense Motive check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Attentive feat gets a +2 bonus on all Sense Motive checks.

A character can use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message is being transmitted via the Bluff skill (DC equal to the bluff check result of the sender). If the character’s check result beats the DC by 5 or more, the character understands the secret message as well.  If the character’s check fails by 5 or more, the character misinterprets the message in some fashion.

**Time:** A Sense Motive check may be made as a reaction to another character’s Bluff check. (When that’s the case, the GM may roll the character’s Sense Motive check in secret, so the character doesn’t necessarily know someone’s trying to bluff him or her.) Using Sense Motive to get a sense of someone’s trustworthiness takes at least 1 minute.

## Sleight of Hand (Dex) Trained Only; Armor Penalty

**Check:** A check against DC 10 lets a character palm a coin-sized, unattended object. Minor feats of sleight of hand, such as making a coin disappear, also have a DC of 10 unless an observer is concentrating on noticing what the character is doing.

When a character performs this skill under close observation, the character’s skill check is opposed by the observer’s Spot check. The observer’s check doesn’t prevent the character from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.

When a character tries to take something from another person, the character’s opponent makes a Spot check to detect the attempt. To obtain the object, the character must get a result of 20 or higher, regardless of the opponent’s check result. The opponent detects the attempt if his or her check result beats the character’s check result, whether the character takes the object or not.

A character can use Sleight of Hand to conceal a small weapon or object on his or her body.

**Try Again?:** A second Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target, or when being watched by the same observer, has a DC 10 higher than the first check if the first check failed or if the attempt was noticed.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Sleight of Hand check, but can’t take 20.

A character can make an untrained Sleight of Hand check to conceal a weapon or object, but must always take 10.

A character with the Nimble feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Sleight of Hand checks.

**Time:** A Sleight of Hand check is an attack action.

## Speak Language (None) Trained Only

The Speak Language skill doesn’t work like a standard skill.

* A character automatically knows how to speak his or her native language; the character does not need ranks to do so.
* Each additional language costs 1 rank. When a character adds a rank to Speak Language, he or she chooses a new language that he or she can speak.
* A character never makes Speak Language checks. A character either knows how to speak and understand a specific language or doesn’t.
* To be able to read and write a language that the character can speak, he or she must take the Read/Write Language skill for the appropriate language.
* A character can choose any language, modern or ancient. (See the table accompanying Read/Write Language for suggestions.) The GM might determine that a character can’t learn a specific language due to the circumstances of the campaign.

## Spot (Wis)

**Check:** The Spot skill is used to notice items that aren’t immediately obvious and people who are attempting to hide. The GM may call for a Spot check by a character who is in a position to notice something. A character can also make a Spot check voluntarily if he or she wants to try to notice something in his or her vicinity.

The GM may make the Spot check in secret so that the character doesn’t know whether not noticing anything means that nothing is there or that the character failed the check.

A successful Spot check when there isn’t anything to notice results in the character noticing nothing.

Spot is often used to notice a person or creature hiding from view. In such cases, the character’s Spot check is opposed by the Hide check of the character trying not to be seen. Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), or to notice a concealed weapon on another person.

A character’s Spot check is modified by a –1 penalty for every 10 feet of distance between the character and the character or object he or she is trying to discern. The check carries a further –5 penalty if the character is in the midst of activity.

**Try Again?:** A character can make a Spot check every time he or she has the opportunity to notice something in a reactive manner. As a full-round action, a character may attempt to notice something that he or she failed (or believe he or she failed) to notice previously.

**Special:** A character can take 10 or take 20 when making a Spot check.

A character with the Alertness feat gets a +2 bonus on all Spot checks.

**Time:** A Spot check is either a reaction (if called for by the GM) or a full-round action (if a character actively takes the time to try to notice something).

## Survival (Wis)

**Check:** A character can keep his or herself and others safe and fed in the wild.

|DC|Task|
|:-:|---|
|10|Get along in the wild. Move up to half the character’s overland speed while hunting and foraging (no food or water supplies needed). The character can provide food and water for one other person for every 2 points by which the character’s check result exceeds 10.|
|15|Gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving up to half the character’s overland speed, or gain a +4 circumstance bonus if stationary. The character may grant the same bonus to one other character for every 1 point by which the character’s check result exceeds 15.|
|18|Avoid getting lost and avoid natural hazards, such as quicksand.|

With the Track feat, a character can use Survival checks to track a character or animal across various terrain types.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Survival check. A character can take 20 when tracking, or if there is no danger or penalty for failure, but not on periodic checks to get along in the wild.

A character with the Guide feat gets a +2 bonus on all Survival checks.

**Time:** Basic Survival checks occur each day in the wilderness or whenever a hazard presents itself. When using Survival with the Track feat to track a character or animal, checks are made according to distance, as described in the Track feat.

## Swim (Str) Armor Penalty

**Check:** A successful Swim check allows a character to swim one-quarter his or her speed as a move action or half the character’s speed as a full-round action. Roll once per round. If the character fails, he or she makes no progress through the water. If the character fails by 5 or more, he or she goes underwater.

If the character is underwater (from failing a swim check or because the character is swimming underwater intentionally), the character must hold his or her breath. A character can hold his or her breath for a number of rounds equal to the character’s Constitution score, but only if the character does nothing but take move actions or free actions. If the character takes an attack action or a full-round action, the amount of breath the character has remaining is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his or her breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, the character must make a Constitution check (DC 10) every round to continue holding his or her breath. Each round, the DC of the check increases by 1. If the character fails the check, the character begins to drown.

The DC for the Swim check depends on the water:

|Water|DC|
|----|:-:|
|Calm water|10|
|Rough water|15|
|Stormy water|20|

Each hour that the character swims, make a Swim check against DC 20. If the character fails, he or she becomes fatigued. If the character fails a check while fatigued, the character becomes exhausted. If the character fails a check while exhausted, the character becomes unconscious. Unconscious characters go underwater and immediately begin to drown.

**Try Again?:** A new check is allowed the round after a check is failed.

**Special:** A character takes a penalty of –1 for every 5 pounds of gear he or she carries, including armor and weapons.

A character can take 10 when making a Swim check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Athletic feat gets a +2 bonus on all Swim checks.

**Time:** A Swim check is either a move action or a full-round action, as described above.

## Treat Injury (Wis)

**Check:** The DC and effect depend on the task attempted.

**Long-Term Care (DC 15):** With a medical kit, the successful application of this skill allows a patient to recover hit points and ability points lost to temporary damage at an advanced rate—3 hit points per character level or 3 ability points restored per day of complete rest. A new check is made each day; on a failed check, recovery occurs at the normal rate for that day of rest and care.

A character can tend up to as many patients as he or she has ranks in the skill. The patients need complete bed rest (doing nothing all day). The character needs to devote at least ½ hour of the day to each patient the character is caring for.

**Restore Hit Points (DC 15):** With a medical kit, if a character has lost hit points, the character can restore some of them. A successful check, as a full-round action, restores 1d4 hit points. The number restored can never exceed the character’s full normal total of hit points. This application of the skill can be used successfully on a character only once per day.

**Revive Dazed, Stunned, or Unconscious Character (DC 15):** With a first aid kit, the character can remove the dazed, stunned, or unconscious condition from a character. This check is an attack action.

A successful check removes the dazed, stunned, or unconscious condition from an affected character. The character can’t revive an unconscious character who is at –1 hit points or lower without first stabilizing the character.

**Stabilize Dying Character (DC 15):** With a medical kit, a character can tend to a character who is dying. As an attack action, a successful Treat Injury check stabilizes another character. The stabilized character regains no hit points, but he or she stops losing them. The character must have a medical kit to stabilize a dying character.

**Surgery (DC 20):** With a surgery kit, a character can conduct field surgery. This application of the Treat Injury skill carries a –4 penalty, which can be negated with the Surgery feat. Surgery requires 1d4 hours; if the patient is at negative hit points, add an additional hour for every point below 0 the patient has fallen.

Surgery restores 1d6 hit points for every character level of the patient (up to the patient’s full normal total of hit points) with a successful skill check.  Surgery can only be used successfully on a character once in a 24-hour period.

A character who undergoes surgery is fatigued for 24 hours, minus 2 hours for every point above the DC the surgeon achieves. The period of fatigue can never be reduced below 6 hours in this fashion.

**Treat Disease (DC 15):** A character can tend to a character infected with a treatable disease. Every time the diseased character makes a saving throw against disease effects (after the initial contamination), the treating character first makes a Treat Injury check to help the diseased character fend off secondary damage. This activity takes 10 minutes. If the treating character’s check succeeds, the treating character provides a bonus on the diseased character’s saving throw equal to his or her ranks in this skill.

**Treat Poison (DC 15):** A character can tend to a poisoned character. When a poisoned character makes a saving throw against a poison’s secondary effect, the treating character first makes a Treat Injury check as an attack action. If the treating character’s check succeeds, the character provides a bonus on the poisoned character’s saving throw equal to his or her ranks in this skill.

**Try Again?:** Yes, for restoring hit points, reviving dazed, stunned, or unconscious characters, stabilizing dying characters, and surgery. No, for all other uses of the skill.

**Special:** The Surgery feat gives a character the extra training he or she needs to use Treat Injury to help a wounded character by means of an operation.

A character can take 10 when making a Treat Injury check. A character can take 20 only when restoring hit points or attempting to revive dazed, stunned, or unconscious characters.

Long-term care, restoring hit points, treating disease, treating poison, or stabilizing a dying character requires a medical kit. Reviving a dazed, stunned, or unconscious character requires either a first aid kit or a medical kit. Surgery requires a surgery kit. If the character does not have the appropriate kit, he or she takes a –4 penalty on the check.

A character can use the Treat Injury skill on his or herself only to restore hit points, treat disease, or treat poison. The character takes a –5 penalty on your check any time he or she treats his or herself.

A character with the Medical Expert feat gets a +2 bonus on all Treat Injury checks.

**Time:** Treat Injury checks take different amounts of time based on the task at hand, as described above.

## Tumble (Dex) Trained Only; Armor Penalty

**Check:** A character can land softly when he or she falls, tumble past opponents in combat, or tumble through opponents.

**Land Softly:** The character can make a Tumble check (DC 15) when falling. If the check succeeds, treat the fall as if it were 10 feet shorter when determining damage.

**Tumble past Opponents:** With a successful Tumble check (DC 15), the character can weave, dodge, and roll up to 20 feet through squares adjacent to opponents, risking no attacks of opportunity. Failure means the character moves as planned, but provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

**Tumble through Opponents:** With a successful Tumble check (DC 25), the character can roll, jump, or dive through squares oc-cupied by opponents, moving over, under, or around them as if they weren’t there. Failure means the character moves as planned, but provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.

**重试：** 不行。

**Special:** A character with 5 or more ranks in Tumble gains a +3 dodge bonus to Defense (instead of the normal +2) when fighting defensively, and a +6 dodge bonus (instead of the normal +4) when engaging in total defense.

A character can take 10 when making a Tumble check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Acrobatic feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Tumble checks.

**Time:** A character can try to reduce damage from a fall as a reaction once per fall. A character can attempt to tumble as a free action that must be performed as part of a move action.
