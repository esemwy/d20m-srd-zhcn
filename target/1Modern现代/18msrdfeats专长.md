**Normal:** Autofire uses ten bullets, targets a 10-foot-by-10-foot area, and can’t be aimed at a specific target. Without this feat, if a character attempts an autofire attack at a specific target, it simply counts as a normal attack and all the extra bullets are wasted.

This number may not exceed the character’s base attack bonus. The changes to attack rolls and Defense last until the character’s next action. The bonus to the character’s Defense is a dodge bonus (and as such it stacks with other dodge bonuses the character may have).

The character may make attacks of opportunity against opponents who provoke such attacks.
