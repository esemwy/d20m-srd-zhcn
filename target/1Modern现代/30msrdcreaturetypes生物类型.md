# CREATURE TYPES

生物的种类决定了生物的许多特性和能力：肉体属性值、生命骰类型、基础攻击加值、豁免骰加值、技能点、专长、以及特殊能力。不同种类的生物，其精神属性值（智力、感知、以及魅力）差别巨大；除非生物种类的描述指定了其中的属性，GM可自行酌情设置属性值。

A creature belongs to one of the fifteen types described below. A single creature cannot have more than one type.

Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses provides the modifiers to a creature’s saving throws and attack rolls based on its type and Hit Dice.
