DEPARTMENT-7

Department-7 is a fictional elite organization that the heroes belong to that deals with situations threatening the modern world. Depending on the campaign, Department-7 might have federal authority, or it might be a state or local agency, or perhaps a private institution. In some campaigns, it might have an international scope thanks to ties to the United Nations or some global conglomerate. Department-7 might deal with homeland defense, law enforcement, espionage and intelligence, or counterterrorism. In some games, it might have a charter to investigate paranormal activity or alien incursions or dimensional displacement.

It is our hope that other publishers will use Department-7 as an example in their products, thereby providing a common feel for the game
