# 技能 I

## 技能描述

技能按字母顺序列出，按照以下格式描述。技能中无效的项将省略。

## 技能描述格式

### 技能名（关键属性）需受训；护甲减值

技能名一行以及以下各行包括了以下信息：

**关键属性：** 应用于技能检定的关键属性的缩写。例外：口头语言和读写语言的关键属性是“无”，因为这些技能的使用不需要检定。

**需受训：** 如果“需受训”出现在技能名旁边，角色的技能必须至少为1级才能使用。如果没有“需受训”，这个技能就可以直接使用。如果技能的使用针对受训与未受训有特别的规则，将会在`特别`一项里阐明。

**护甲减值：** 如果“护甲减值”出现在技能名旁边，技能检定要受到护甲的护甲减值影响。

**检定：** 角色要成功使用技能该执行的检定，以及检定DC。

**重试：** 要再次尝试使用技能所要满足的条件。如果没有这一项，重试技能检定除了需要再花时间外没有任何固有惩罚。

**特别：** 其他任何特别的事项，比如角色使用此技能是否能取10取20。

**未受训：** 在未受训情况下使用此技能的说明。如果没有这一项，即表示技能是否受训效果都是一样的，或者是不允许未受训就使用（如果技能标明了“需受训”）。

**时间：** 一次此技能的检定要花的时长。

## 平衡（敏） 护甲减值

**检定：** 角色可以在不稳定的表面行走。一次成功的检定可以使角色以半速在这种表面上用一个移动动作行走。检定失败则表示角色要花费一个移动动作保持平衡，无法移动。检定结果低于DC5点或者更多，角色会`坠落`。不同的表面的难度值见下表。

|狭窄表面|DC\*|困难表面|DC|
|--------------|:-:|-----------------|:-:|
|7–12寸宽|10|不平坦或者有棱角的|10|
|2–6寸宽|15|光滑的表面|10|
|低于2寸宽|20|||

\* 狭窄表面若是光滑或有棱角则+5DC；光滑且有棱角则+10DC。

**平衡时被攻击：** 平衡时，角色处于`措手不及`状态（角色防御将失去敏捷加值），除非角色的平衡不小于5级。如果角色承受伤害，角色必须再做一次平衡检定以保持站立。

**加速移动：** 角色可以尝试以比平常更快的速度穿过不稳定的表面。角色可以以常速移动，但角色的平衡检定要受5点减值。（角色一轮内移动两倍于常速的距离需要检定两次，每个移动动作各一次。）

角色可以试图冲过不稳定的表面。冲锋时，每一倍于常速（超而未满向上取整）都要进行一次带5点减值的平衡检定。

**特殊：** 角色可以在平衡检定中取10， 但不能取20。

有全神贯注专长的角色的平衡检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 半速移动时的平衡是一个移动动作。

常速移动时的平衡也是一个移动动作。

## 唬骗（魅）

**检定：** 试图欺骗或误导所需进行的唬骗检定，是要与目标的察言观色检定对抗的。有利和不利的情况对唬骗结果的影响占了很大比重。以下两种情景对唬骗不利：唬骗本身可信度低，或者唬骗行为要求目标做违背自己的利益、天性、个性或者命令的事。

如果有必要，GM可以区分唬骗失败的原因到底是目标不相信还是要求太多。举个例子，如果目标因为唬骗要求目标冒一定风险而获得10点加值，而目标的察言观色检定结果高于唬骗10点以及更低，则视为目标并未识破唬骗而是因为太难而拒绝。如果目标察言观色检定结果高于唬骗11以及更多，目标则是看穿了唬骗，唬骗者还未提任何要求就被拒绝了（也就是没有那10点加值，目标也成功了）。

一个成功的唬骗检定意味着目标按照角色希望的样子做出反应，至少短时间如此（通常1轮或更短），或者意味着目标相信了角色希望目标相信的事。

一次唬骗需要角色与目标之间可以交流。目标不懂角色在表达什么则不会被唬骗。

|示例情景|察言观色调整值|
|---------------------|:-------------------:|
|目标希望相信角色。|–5|
|唬骗内容是可信的且对目标影响不大。|+0|
|唬骗内容有点难以置信或者会让目标冒一定风险。|+5|
|唬骗内容难以置信或者会让目标冒很大的风险。|+10|
|唬骗内容非常荒谬，太难以置信了。|+20|

唬骗跟说谎是两码事。唬骗是用含糊其辞的方式分心、迷惑、误导，是短时间的行为。唬骗并不是瞒天过海、精心设计，更多的是猝然地打断行为或者决定。唬骗更多用到神态和肢体语言，也经常包括了谎言，但不是精心编造的，也别指望能让目标相信太久；

而一个谎言只是捏造事实而已。肢体语言和神态并不是交流的重心，而谎言则可以经过精心编排，滴水不漏，目的是欺骗角色一段时间，至少直到角色发现相反的证据。角色不需要每次说谎都做唬骗检定。

**战斗中的虚招：** 角色也可以在战斗中用唬骗来误导对手，让对手无法有效地闪避角色的攻击。如果角色成功，角色对对手的下一次攻击无视其敏捷加值（如果对手有），以此降低对手的防御值。用这种方法唬骗只有动物智力（智力1或2）的生物，唬骗检定会有8点减值。对付非智能生物，虚招永远是无效的。

**转移注意力以躲藏：** 角色可以使用唬骗帮助自己躲藏。一次成功的唬骗检定可让角色分散搜捕者的注意力一小会，让自己此时可以做一次躲藏检定。（见躲藏技能）

**传递密信：** 角色可以在谈论其他事情时，用一次唬骗传递和理解秘密信息。基本信息的DC是10。复杂的信息或者试图交流新的信息将会有15或20的DC。传递者和接受者各需要做一次检定以示阐明和理解。

任何听到密信的人都可以做一次察言观色检定（DC等于传递者的唬骗检定结果）。如果成功，偷听者会意识到交流中包含的密信。如果成功结果超过DC大于等于5点，偷听者将会破译密信。

无论是发送还是接收密信，失败5点或更多将意味着其中一方表达错误或另一方曲解了密信的内容。

**重试：** 通常，失败的唬骗检定让目标提高警惕，对相同情景下同一角色的唬骗行为戒心更重。而战斗中的虚招则可以随便重试。

**特别：** 角色可以在唬骗时取10（战斗中虚招除外），但不能取20。

有欺诈专长的角色的唬骗检定有2点加值。

**时间：** 唬骗至少花费1轮的时间（至少是一个整轮动作），唬骗内容越复杂花的时间越多。在战斗中用唬骗使出虚招是一个攻击动作。

## 攀爬（力） 护甲减值

**检定：** 每次成功的攀爬检定，角色可向上、下移动，或者翻越斜坡或者墙面或者其他陡峭的斜面（甚至是有把手点的天花板）。

斜坡指的是任何坡度小于60度的坡道；墙指的是任何坡度大于等于60度的坡道。

一个失败的攀爬检定意味着角色没有任何进展，失败大于等于5点则意味着角色坠落，不管角色达到了多少高度（除非角色有登山索或其他装备保障安全）。

检定DC取决于攀爬情况。如果攀爬低于10尺，DC-5。

既然角色不能移动以回避攻击，角色在攀爬时是措手不及的（角色的防御失去任何敏捷加值）。

只要角色在攀爬时承受伤害，都要进行一次攀爬检定，对抗斜坡或墙的DC。失败则意味着角色从当前的高度在坠落，并承受相应的坠落伤害。

**加速攀爬：** 角色可以试着以快于平常的速度攀爬。角色可以常速移动，但攀爬检定要再承受5点减值。（角色一轮内移动两倍于常速的距离需要检定两次，每个移动动作各一次。）

**制造把手点和脚踏点：** 角色可以将岩钉打入墙中，制造把手点和脚踏点。每打一个岩钉需要1分钟，每3尺需要一个岩钉。在任何有把手点和脚踏点的表面，有岩钉的墙攀爬DC为15。类似的方法，有冰斧或类似工具的攀爬者可以在冰墙中凿出把手点和脚踏点。

**抓稳以停止坠落：** 角色在墙上坠落时几乎不可能抓住自己。要这么做需要做一个攀爬检定（DC为墙的DC再加20）。斜坡则相对容易抓住（DC为斜坡DC+10）。

**特别：** 使用绳索的人可以纯粹用力量将人往上（或往下）拉。角色最多能拉动两倍于自身最大负载的重量。

角色攀爬可取10，但不能取20。

无攀爬装备的角色的攀爬检定将有4点减值。由GM自由裁量具体的情况要求何种装备，只需要一根绳索还是其他工具，或者仅仅只需手脚而不是整套攀爬装备就可以避免减值。

有竞技专长的角色的攀爬检定有2点加值。

|DC|示例墙或者表面或者目的|
|:-:|------------------------------|
|0|陡到不能走的斜坡。|
|5|带绳结的绳索和可以踩着爬的墙。|
|10|没绳结的绳索和可以踩着爬的墙。单条带绳结的绳索。有足够抱住和站立的突出部的表面，比如崎岖的峭壁表面。|
|15|有足够抓住的把手点和脚踏点（天然或人工）的表面，比如粗糙的天然岩石表面、一棵树、或者铁丝网围栏。单条没绳结的绳索。仅靠手悬挂着引体向上。|
|20|不平的表面上只有少量狭窄的把手点和脚踏点，比如粗糙的石墙或只有少量裂隙和落脚点的峻峭的峭壁。|
|25|没有真正的把手点和脚踏点的粗糙表面，比如砖墙。|
|25|只有把手点没有脚踏点的岩崖或天花板。|
|—|极度光滑、平整、垂直的墙，不可攀爬。|
|–10\*|在通风管或者其他可以踩着两面相对的墙的地方攀爬（正常DC-10）。|
|–5\*|在可以踩着相互垂直的墙面的墙脚的地方攀爬（正常DC-5）。|
|+5\*|光滑的表面（正常DC+5）。|

\*此调整值是累加的，满足即应用。

**时间：** 以半速攀爬是一个整轮动作。按此速度只移动一般距离（角色常速的1/4）是一个移动动作。

能让角色以常速攀爬的加速攀爬，是一个整轮动作。角色可以用一个移动动作只移动一半距离（角色常速的一半）。

## Computer Use (Int)

**Check:** Most normal computer operations don’t require a Computer Use check (though a character might have to make a Research check; see the Research skill description). However, searching an unfamiliar network for a particular file, writing computer programs, altering existing programs to perform differently (better or worse), and breaking through computer security are all relatively difficult and require skill checks.

**Find File:** This skill can be used for finding files or data on an unfamiliar system. The DC for the check and the time required are determined by the size of the site on which the character is searching.

Finding public information on the Internet does not fall under this category; usually, such a task requires a Research check. This application of the Computer Use skill only pertains to finding files on private systems with which the character is not familiar.

|Size of Site|DC|Time|
|------------|:-:|---|
|Personal computer|10|1 round|
|Small office network|15|2 rounds|
|Large office network|20|1 minute|
|Massive corporate network|25|10 minutes|

**Defeat Computer Security:** This application of Computer Use can’t be used untrained. The DC is determined by the quality of the security program installed to defend the system. If the check is failed by 5 or more, the security system immediately alerts its administrator that there has been an unauthorized entry. An alerted administrator may attempt to identify the character or cut off the character’s access to the system.

Sometimes, when accessing a difficult site, the character has to defeat security at more than one stage of the operation. If the character beats the DC by 10 or more when attempting to defeat computer security, the character automatically succeeds at all subsequent security checks at that site until the end of the character’s session (see Computer Hacking below).

|Level of Security|DC|
|----------------|:-:|
|Minimum|20|
|Average|25|
|Exceptional|35|
|Maximum|40|

### Computer Hacking

Breaking into a secure computer or network is often called hacking.

When a character hacks, he or she attempts to invade a site. A site is a virtual location containing files, data, or applications. A site can be as small as a single computer, or as large as a corporate network connecting computers and data archives all over the world—the important thing is that access to the site connects the user to everything within it. Some sites can be accessed via the Internet; others are not connected to any outside network and can only be tapped into by a user who physically accesses a computer connected to the site.

Every site is overseen by a system administrator—the person in charge of the site, and who maintains its security. Often, the system administrator is the only person with access to all of a site’s functions and data. A site can have more than one system administrator; large sites have a system administrator on duty at all times. A character is the system administrator of his or her personal computer.

When a character hacks into a site, the visit is called a session. Once a character stops accessing the site, the session is over. The character can go back to the site in the future; when he or she does, it’s a new session.

#### Several steps are required to hack into a site:

**Covering Tracks:** This step is optional. By making a Computer Use check (DC 20), a character can alter his or her identifying information. This imposes a –5 penalty on any attempt made to identify the character if his or her activity is detected.

**Access the Site:** There are two ways to do this: physically or over the Internet.

**Physical Access:** A character gains physical access to the computer, or a computer connected to the site.  If the site being hacked is not connected to the Internet, this is probably the only way a character can access it. A variety of skill checks may be required, depending on the method used to gain access.

**Internet Access:** Reaching a site over the net requires two Computer Use checks. The first check (DC 10) is needed to find the site on the net. The second is a check to defeat computer security (see the Computer Use skill description). Once a character has succeeded in both checks, the character has accessed the site.

**Locate What You’re Looking For:** To find the data (or application, or remote device) the character wants, make a Computer Use check. See Find File under the skill description.

**Defeat File Security:** Many networks have additional file security.  If that’s the case, the character needs to make another check to defeat computer security.

**Do Your Stuff:** Finally, the character can actually do what he or she came to do. If the character just wants to look at records, no additional check is needed. (A character can also download data, although that often takes several rounds—or even several minutes, for especially large amounts of information—to complete.) Altering or deleting records sometimes requires yet another check to defeat computer security. Other operations can be carried out according to the Computer Use skill description.

**Defend Security:** If the character is the system administrator for a site (which may be as simple as being the owner of a laptop), he or she can defend the site against intruders. If the site alerts the character to an intruder, the character can attempt to cut off the intruder’s access (end the intruder’s session), or even to identify the intruder.

To cut off access, make an opposed Computer Use check against the intruder. If the character succeeds, the intruder’s session is ended. The intruder might be able to defeat the character’s security and access his or her site again, but the intruder will have to start the hacking process all over. Attempting to cut off access takes a full round.

One surefire way to prevent further access is to simply shut the site down. With a single computer, that’s often no big deal—but on a large site with many computers (or computers controlling functions that can’t be interrupted), it may be time-consuming or even impossible.

To identify the intruder, make an opposed Computer Use check against the intruder. If the character succeeds, the character learns the site from which the intruder is operating (if it’s a single computer, the character learns the name of the computer’s owner). Identifying the intruder requires 1 minute and is a separate check from cutting off access. This check can only be made if the intruder is accessing the character’s site for the entire length of the check—if the intruder’s session ends before the character finishes the check, the character automatically fails.

**Degrade Programming:** A character can destroy or alter applications on a computer to make use of that computer harder or impossible. The DC for the attempt depends on what the character tries to do. Crashing a computer simply shuts it down. Its user can restart it without making a skill check (however, restarting takes 1 minute). Destroying programming makes the computer unusable until the programming is repaired. Damaging programming imposes a –4 penalty on all Computer Use checks made with the computer (sometimes this is preferable to destroying the programming, since the user might not know that anything is wrong, and won’t simply decide to use a different computer).

A character can degrade the programming of multiple computers at a single site; doing so adds +2 to the DC for each additional computer.

|Scope of Alteration|DC|Time|
|------------------|:-:|----|
|Crash computer|10|1 minute|
|Destroy programming|15|10 minutes|
|Damage programming|20|10 minutes|

Fixing the degraded programming requires 1 hour and a Computer Use check against a DC equal to the DC for degrading it + 5.

**Write Program:** A character can create a program to help with a specific task. Doing so grants the character a +2 circumstance bonus to the task.

A specific task, in this case, is one type of operation with one target.

The DC to write a program is 20; the time required is 1 hour.

**Operate Remote Device:** Many devices are computer-operated via remote links. If the character has access to the computer that controls such systems, the character can either shut them off or change their operating parameters. The DC depends on the nature of the operation. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the system immediately alerts its administrator that there has been an unauthorized use of the equipment. An alerted administrator may attempt to identify the character or cut off his or her access to the system.

|Type of Operation|DC|Time|
|----------------|:-:|:--:|
|Shut down passive remote (including cameras and door locks)|20|1 round per remote|
|Shut down active remote (including motion detectors and alarms)|25|1 round per remote|
|Reset parameters|30|1 minute per remote|
|Change passcodes|25|1 minute|
|Hide evidence of alteration|+10|1 minute|
|Minimum security|–5|—|
|Exceptional security|+10|—|
|Maximum security|+15|—|

**Special:** A character can take 10 when using the Computer Use skill. A character can take 20 in some cases, but not in those that involve a penalty for failure. (A character cannot take 20 to defeat computer security or defend security.)

A character with the Gearhead feat gets a +2 bonus on all Computer Use checks.

**Time:** Computer Use requires at least a full-round action. The GM may determine that some tasks require several rounds, a few minutes, or longer, as described above.

## Concentration (Con)

**Check:** A character makes a Concentration check whenever he or she may potentially be distracted while engaged in some action that requires his or her full attention (such as making a Disable Device or Treat Injury check). Situations such as taking damage, working in a bouncing vehicle, or dealing with severe weather can require a character to make a Concentration check.

If the Concentration check succeeds, the character may continue with the action. If the Concentration check fails, the action automatically fails (with the appropriate ramifications, if any), and the action is wasted.

A successful Concentration check still doesn’t allow a character to take 10 when in a stressful situation; he or she must roll the check as normal.

The check DC depends on the nature of the distraction.

**Try Again?:** Yes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such as the disruption of an action that was being concentrated on.

**Special:** A character can use Concentration to avoid attacks of opportunity when attempting a skill check that normally provokes attacks of opportunity. The DC to do so is 15.

If the Concentration check succeeds, the character may attempt the action normally without incurring any attacks of opportunity. If the Concentration check fails, the related check automatically fails just as if the character’s concentration had been disrupted by a distraction. The character does not provoke attacks of opportunity, however.

This use of Concentration applies only to skill checks. It does not apply to other actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity, such as movement or making unarmed attacks.

A character with the Focused feat gets a +2 bonus on all Concentration checks.

The concentration skill has further uses for characters using magic or psionics.

**Time:** Making a Concentration check doesn’t require an action; it is either a reaction (when attempted in response to a distraction) or part of another action (when at-tempted actively).

|Distraction|DC|
|-----------|--|
|Damaged during the action\*|10 + damage dealt|
|Taking continuous damage during the action\*\*|10 + half of continuous damage last dealt|
|Vigorous motion (bouncy vehicle ride, small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, riding a horse)|10|
|Violent motion (very rough vehicle ride, small boat in rapids, on deck of storm-tossed ship, galloping horse)|15|
|Extraordinarily violent motion (earthquake)|20|
|Entangled in net or snare|15|
|Grappling or pinned|20|
|Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet|5|
|Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris|10|

\* Such as an activity that requires more than a single full-round action. Also from an attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action).

\*\* Such as from catching on fire.

Craft (Int)
**This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill:** Craft (chemical), Craft (electronic), Craft (mechanical), Craft (pharmaceutical), Craft (structural), Craft (visual arts), and Craft (writing).
Craft skills are specifically focused on creating objects. To use a Craft skill effectively, a character must have a kit or some other set of basic tools. The purchase DC of this equipment varies according to the particular Craft skill.
To use Craft, first decide what the character is trying to make and consult the category descriptions below. Make a Wealth check against the given purchase DC for the object to see if the character succeeds in acquiring the raw materials. If the character succeeds at that check, make the Craft check against the given DC for the object in question. If the character fails the check, he or she does not make the object, and the raw materials are wasted (unless otherwise noted).
Generally, a character can take 10 when using a Craft skill to construct an object, but can’t take 20 (since doing so represents multiple attempts, and the character uses up the raw materials after the first attempt). The exception is Craft (writing); a character can take 20 because the character does not use up any raw materials (and thus no Wealth check is required to use the skill).

Craft (chemical) (Int) Trained Only
This skill allows a character to mix chemicals to create acids, bases, explosives, and poisonous substances.
**Acids and Bases:** Acids are corrosives substances. Bases neutralize acids but do not deal damage. A base of a certain type counteracts an acid of the same type or a less potent type.

|Type of Acid|Purchase DC|Acid\*|Base\*|Time\*|
|------------|:---------:|:----:|:----:|------|
|Mild (1d6/1d10)\*\*|8|15|10|1 min|
|Potent (2d6/2d10)|12|20|15|30 min|
|Concentrated (3d6/3d10)|16|30|20|1 hr.|

\*Craft DCs

\*\*The dice rolls in parentheses are typical contact damage/immersion damage caused per round of immersion.

**Explosives:** Building an explosive from scratch is dangerous. If the Craft (chemical) check fails, the raw materials are wasted. If the check fails by 5 or more, the explosive compound detonates as it is being made, dealing half of its intended damage to the builder and anyone else in the burst radius.

If the check succeeds, the final product is a solid material, about the size of a brick. An explosive compound does not include a fuse or detonator. Connecting a fuse or detonator requires a Demolitions check.

|Type of Scratch-Built Explosive|Purchase DC|Craft DC|Reflex DC (save for half damage)|Time|
|-------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:------------------------------:|:--:|
|Improvised (1d6/5 feet)\*|6|10|10|1 round|
|Simple (2d6/5 feet)|12|15|12|10 min|
|Moderate (4d6/10 feet)|16|20|12|1 hr.|
|Complex (6d6/15 feet)|20|25|15|3 hr.|
|Powerful (8d6/20 feet)|25|30|15|12 hr.|
|Devastating (10d6/25 feet)|30|35|18|24 hr.|

\* The figures in parentheses are typical damage/burst radius for each type of explosive.

Scratch built explosives deal concussion damage.

**Poisonous Substances:** Solid poisons are usually ingested. Liquid poisons are most effective when injected directly into the bloodstream. Gaseous poisons must be inhaled to be effective. The table below summarizes the characteristics of various poisons.

**Save DC:** The Difficulty Class of the Fortitude save to negate the effects of the poison.

**Initial Damage:** The damage a character takes immediately upon failing his or her Fortitude save.

**Secondary Damage:** The damage a character takes after 1 minute of exposure to the poison if the character fails a second saving throw. Ability score damage is temporary, unless marked with an asterisk, in which case the damage is permanent ability drain. Unconsciousness lasts for 1d3 hours, and paralysis lasts 2d6 minutes.

**Purchase DC:** The DC for the Wealth check necessary to obtain the raw materials to craft the poison, or to purchase one bottle of solid or liquid poison or one high-pressure cylinder of gaseous poison. A bottle holds four doses, while a cylinder holds enough gas to fill a 10-foot-radius area.

**Restriction:** The restriction rating for the poison, if any, and the appropriate black market purchase DC modifier. Remember to apply this modifier to the purchase DC when making a Wealth check to acquire the poison on the black market.

**Craft DC:** The DC of the Craft check to create a quantity of the poison.

**Time:** The amount of time required for the Craft check.

If the Craft check succeeds, the final product is a synthesized solid or liquid poison stored in a bottle (containing 4 doses) or a gas stored in a pressurized cylinder. When released, the gas is sufficient to fill a 10-foot-radius area and takes 1 round to fill the area.

**Table:** Poisons

**Special:** A character without a chemical kit takes a –4 penalty on Craft (chemical) checks.

A character with the Builder feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (chemical) checks.

## Craft (electronic) (Int) Trained Only

This skill allows a character to build electronic equipment from scratch, such as audio and video equipment, timers and listening devices, or radios and communication devices.

When building an electronic device from scratch, the character describes the kind of device he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides whether the device is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced com-pared to current technology.

|Type of Scratch-Built Electronics (Examples)|Purchase DC|Craft DC|Time|
|--------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:--:|
|Simple (timer or detonator)|8|15|1 hr.|
|Moderate (radio direction finder, electronic lock)|12|20|12 hr.|
|Complex (cell phone)|16|25|24 hr.|
|Advanced (computer)|22|30|60 hr.|

**Special:** A character without an electrical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on Craft (electronic) checks.

A character with the Builder feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (electronic) checks.

## Craft (mechanical) (Int) Trained Only

This skill allows a character to build mechanical devices from scratch, including engines and engine parts, weapons, armor, and other gadgets. When building a mechanical device from scratch, the character describes the kind of device he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides if the device is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced compared to current technology.

|Type of Scratch-Built Mechanical Device (Examples)|Purchase DC|Craft DC|Time|
|--------------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:--:|
|Simple (tripwire trap)|5|15|1 hr|
|Moderate (engine component, light armor)|12|20|12 hr.|
|Complex (automobile engine, 9mm autoloader handgun)|16|25|24 hr.|
|Advanced (jet engine)|20|30|60 hr.|

**Special:** A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on Craft (mechanical) checks.

A character with the Builder feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (mechanical) checks.

## Craft (pharmaceutical) (Int) Trained Only

This skill allows a character to compound medicinal drugs to aid in recovery from treatable illnesses. A medicinal drug gives a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves made to resist the effects of a disease.

The Craft (pharmaceutical) check is based on the severity of the disease to be countered as measured by the DC of the Fortitude save needed to resist it.

|Disease Fortitude Save DC|Purchase DC|Craft DC|Time|
|-------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:--:|
|14 or lower|5|15|1 hr.|
|15–18|10|20|3 hr.|
|19–22|15|25|6 hr.|
|23 or higher|20|30|12 hr.|

**Special:** A character without a pharmacist kit takes a –4 penalty on Craft (pharmaceutical) checks.

A character with the Medical Expert feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (pharmaceutical) checks.

## Craft (structural) (Int)

This skill allows a character to build wooden, concrete, or metal structures from scratch, including bookcases, desks, walls, houses, and so forth, and includes such handyman skills as plumbing, house painting, drywall, laying cement, and building cabinets.

|Type of Scratch-Built Structure (Examples)|Purchase DC|Craft DC|Time|
|------------------------------------------|:---------:|:------:|:--:|
|Simple (bookcase, false wall)|5|15|12 hr.|
|Moderate (catapult, shed, house deck)|10|20|24 hr.|
|Complex (bunker, domed ceiling)|15|25|60 hr.|
|Advanced (house)|20|30|600 hr.|

When building a structure from scratch, the character describes the kind of structure he or she wants to construct; then the Gamemaster decides if the structure is simple, moderate, complex, or advanced in scope and difficulty.

**Special:** A character without a mechanical tool kit takes a –4 penalty on Craft (structural) checks.

A character with the Builder feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (structural) checks.

## Craft (visual art) (Int)

This skill allows a character to create paintings or drawings, take photographs, use a video camera, or in some other way create a work of visual art.

When attempting to create a work of visual art, the character simply makes a Craft (visual art) check, the result of which determines the quality of the work.

Unless the effort is particularly elaborate or the character must acquire an expensive piece of equipment, the basic components have a purchase DC of 5.

|Skill Check Result|Effort Achieved|
|------------------|---------------|
|9 or lower|Untalented amateur|
|10–19|Talented amateur|
|20–24|Professional|
|25–30|Expert|
|31 or higher|Master|

Creating a work of visual art requires at least a full-round action, but usually takes an hour, a day, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

**Special:** A character with the Creative feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (visual art) checks.

## Craft (writing) (Int)

This skill allows a character to create short stories, novels, scripts and screenplays, newspaper articles and columns, and similar works of writing.

When creating a work of writing, the player simply makes a Craft (writing) check, the result of which determines the quality of the work.

No Wealth check is necessary to use this Craft skill.

|Skill Check Result|Effort Achieved|
|------------------|---------------|
|9 or lower|Untalented amateur|
|10–19|Talented amateur|
|20–24|Professional|
|25–30|Expert|
|31 or higher|Master|

Creating a work of writing requires at least 1 hour, but usually takes a day, a week, or more, depending on the scope of the project.

**Special:** A character with the Creative feat gets a +2 bonus on all Craft (writing) checks.

## Decipher Script (Int) Trained Only

**Check:** A character can decipher writing in an ancient language or in code, or interpret the meaning of an incomplete text. The base DC is 20 for the simplest messages, 25 for standard codes, and 30 or higher for intricate or complex codes or exotic messages. Helpful texts or computer programs can provide a bonus (usually a +2 circumstance bonus) on the check, provided they are applicable to the script in question.

If the check succeeds, the character understands the general content of a piece of writing, reading about one page of text or its equivalent in 1 minute. If the check fails, the GM makes a Wisdom check (DC 10) for the character to see if he or she avoids drawing a false conclusion about the text. (Success means that the character does not draw a false conclusion; failure means that the character does.)

The GM secretly makes both the skill check and the Wisdom check so the character can’t tell whether the conclusion drawn is accurate or not.

**Try Again?:** No, unless conditions change or new information is uncovered.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Decipher Script check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Studious feat gets a +2 bonus on all Decipher Script checks.

**Time:** Decipher Script takes 1 minute or more, depending on the complexity of the code.

## Demolitions (Int) Trained Only

**Check:** Setting a simple explosive to blow up at a certain spot doesn’t require a check, but connecting and setting a detonator does. Also, placing an explosive for maximum effect against a structure calls for a check, as does disarming an explosive device.

**Set Detonator:** Most explosives require a detonator to go off. Connecting a detonator to an explosive requires a Demolitions check (DC 10). Failure means that the explosive fails to go off as planned. Failure by 10 or more means the explosive goes off as the detonator is being installed.

A character can make an explosive difficult to disarm. To do so, the character chooses the disarm DC before making his or her check to set the detonator (it must be higher than 10). The character’s DC to set the detonator is equal to the disarm DC.

**Place Explosive Device:** Carefully placing an explosive against a fixed structure (a stationary, unattended inanimate object) can maximize the damage dealt by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structure’s construction.

The GM makes the check (so that the character doesn’t know exactly how well he or she has done). On a result of 15 or higher, the explosive deals double damage to the structure against which it is placed. On a result of 25 or higher, it deals triple damage to the structure. In all cases, it deals normal damage to all other targets within its burst radius.

**Disarm Explosive Device:** Disarming an explosive that has been set to go off requires a Demolitions check. The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the detonator chose a higher disarm DC. If the character fails the check, he or she does not disarm the explosive. If the character fails by more than 5, the explosive goes off.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when using the Demolitions skill, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Cautious feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Demolitions checks.

A character without a demolitions kit takes a –4 penalty on Demolitions checks.

Making an explosive requires the Craft (chemical) skill. See that skill description for details.

**Time:** Setting a detonator is usually a full-round action. Placing an explosive device takes 1 minute or more, depending on the scope of the job.

## Diplomacy (Cha)

**Check:** A character can change others’ attitudes with a successful check (see the table below. In negotiations, participants roll opposed Diplomacy checks to see who gains the advantage. Opposed checks also resolve cases where two advocates or diplomats plead opposing cases before a third party.

Diplomacy can be used to influence a GM character’s attitude. The GM chooses the character’s initial attitude based on circumstances. Most of the time, the people the heroes meet are indifferent toward them, but a specific situation may call for a different initial attitude. The DCs given in the accompanying table show what it takes to change someone’s attitude with the use of the Diplomacy skill. The character doesn’t declare a specific outcome he or she is trying for; instead, make the check and compare the result to the table on the next page.

**Try Again?:** Generally, trying again doesn’t work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can only be persuaded so far. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly committed to his or her position, and trying again is futile.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Diplomacy check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Trustworthy feat gets a +2 bonus on all Diplomacy checks.

**Time:** Diplomacy is at least a full-round action. The GM may determine that some negotiations require a longer period of time.

|Attitude|Means|Possible Actions|
|--------|-----|----------------|
|Hostile|Will take risks to hurt or avoid you|Attack, interfere, berate, flee|
|Unfriendly|Wishes you ill|Mislead, gossip, avoid, watch suspiciously, insult|
|Indifferent|Doesn’t much care|Act as socially expected|
|Friendly|Wishes you well|Chat, advise, offer limited help, advocate|
|Helpful|Will take risks to help you|Protect, back up, heal, aid|

|Initial Attitude\\New Attitude|Hostile|Unf.|Indif.|Friendly|Helpful|
|------------------------------|:-----:|:--:|:----:|:------:|:-----:|
|Hostile|19 or less|20|25|35|45|
|Unfriendly|4 or less|5|15|25|35|
|Indifferent|—|0 or less|1|15|25|
|Friendly|—|—|0 or less|1|15|

### Bribery and Diplomacy

Offering money or another form of favor can, in the right situation, improve a character’s chances with a Diplomacy skill check. Bribery allows a character to circumvent various official obstacles when a person in a position of trust or authority is willing to accept such an offering.

An illegal act, bribery requires two willing participants—one to offer a bribe and the other to accept it.  When a character requires a bribe to render services, then a hero’s Diplomacy check automatically fails if a bribe isn’t attached to it. If a bribe isn’t requires, a hero can add a bribe to get a bonus on his or her skill check. This can backfire, as some characters will be insulted by a bribe offer (their attitude changes one step for the worse) and others will report the hero to the proper authorities.

To bribe a character, make a Wealth check. Typical DCs are shown on below, but the GM may modify the DC as he or she sees fit. If the hero succeeds in the check, he or she gains a +2 bonus on the Diplomacy check. For every point by which the hero beats the DC, increase the bonus by +1 (to a total maximum bonus of +10).

|Bribe Target|Purchase DC|
|------------|:---------:|
|Bouncer|6|
|Bureaucrat|10|
|Informant|7|
|Police officer|10|

## Disable Device (Int) Trained Only

**Check:** The GM makes the Disable Device check so that the character doesn’t necessarily know whether he or she has succeeded.

**Open Lock:** A character can pick conventional locks, finesse combination locks, and bypass electronic locks. The character must have a lockpick set (for a mechanical lock) or an electrical tool kit (for an electronic lock). The DC depends on the quality of the lock.

|Lock Type (Example)|DC|
|-----------------|:--:|
|Cheap (briefcase lock)|20|
|Average (home deadbolt)|25|
|High quality (business deadbolt)|30|
|High security (branch bank vault)|40|
|Ultra-high security (bank headquarters vault)|50|

**Disable Security Device:** A character can disable a security device, such as an electric fence, motion sensor, or security camera. The character must be able to reach the actual device. If the device is monitored, the fact that the character attempted to disable it will probably be noticed.

When disabling a monitored device, the character can prevent his or her tampering from being noticed. Doing so requires 10 minutes and an electrical tool kit, and increases the DC of the check by +10.

|Device Type (Example)|DC|
|-------------------|:--:|
|Cheap (home door alarm)|20|
|Average (store security camera)|25|
|High quality (art museum motion detector)|30|
|High security (bank vault alarm)|35|
|Ultrahigh security (motion detector at Area 51)|40|

**Traps and Sabotage:** Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a simple mechanical device has a DC of 10. More intricate and complex devices have higher DCs. The GM rolls the check. If the check succeeds, the character disables the device. If the check fails by 4 or less, the character has failed but can try again. If the character fails by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If it’s a trap, the character springs it. If it’s some sort of sabotage, the character thinks the device is disabled, but it still works normally.

A character can rig simple devices to work normally for a while and then fail some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).

**Try Again?:** Yes, though the character must be aware that he or she has failed in order to try again.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when making a Disable Device check. A character can take 20 to open a lock or to disable a security device, unless the character is trying to prevent his or her tampering from being noticed.

Possessing the proper tools gives a character the best chance of succeeding on a Disable Device check. Opening a lock requires a lockpick set (for a mechanical lock) or an electrical tool kit (for an electronic lock). Opening a locked car calls for a car opening kit. Disabling a security device requires either a mechanical tool kit or an electronic toll kit, depending on the nature of the device. If the character does not have the appropriate tools, he or she takes a –4 penalty on your check.

A lock release gun can open a mechanical lock of cheap or average quality without a Disable Device check.

A character with the Cautious feat and at least 1 rank in this skill gets a +2 bonus on all Disable Device checks.

**Time:** Disabling a simple mechanical device is a full-round action. Intricate or complex devices require 2d4 rounds.

## Disguise (Cha)

**Check:** A character’s Disguise check result determines how good the disguise is. It is opposed by others’ Spot check results. Make one Disguise check even if several people make Spot checks. The GM makes the character’s Disguise check secretly so that the character is not sure how well his or her disguise holds up to scrutiny.

If the character doesn’t draw any attention to him or herself, however, others don’t get to make Spot checks. If the character comes to the attention of people who are suspicious, the suspicious person gets to make a Spot check. (The GM can assume that such observers take 10 on their Spot checks.)

The effectiveness of the character’s disguise depends in part on how much the character is attempting to change his or her appearance.

|Disguise|Modifier|
|--------|:------:|
|Minor details only|+5|
|Appropriate uniform or costume|+2|
|Disguised as different sex|–2|
|Disguised as different age category|–2\*|

\* Per step of difference between the character’s age category and the disguised age category (child, young adult, adult, middle age, old, or venerable).

If the character is impersonating a particular individual, those who know what that person looks like automatically get to make Spot checks. Furthermore, they get a bonus on their Spot checks.

|Familiarity|Bonus|
|-----------|:---:|
|Recognizes on sight|+4|
|Friend or associate|+6|
|Close friend|+8|
|Intimate|+10|

Usually, an individual makes a Spot check to detect a disguise immediately upon meeting the character and each hour thereafter. If the character casually meets many different people, each for a short time, the GM checks once per day or hour, using an average Spot modifier for the group (assuming they take 10).

**Try Again?:** No, though the character can assume the same disguise again at a later time. If others saw through the previous disguise, they are automatically treated as suspicious if the character assumes the same disguise again.

**Special:** A character can take 10 or take 20 when establishing a disguise.

A character without a disguise kit takes a –4 penalty on Disguise checks.

A character with the Deceptive feat gets a +2 bonus on all Disguise checks.

A character can help someone else create a disguise for him or her, treating it as an aid another attempt.

**Time:** A Disguise check requires 1d4 x10 minutes of preparation. The GM makes Spot checks for those who encounter the character immediately upon meeting the character and again each hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.

## Drive (Dex)

**Check:** Routine tasks, such as ordinary driving, don’t require a skill check. Make a check only when some unusual circumstance exists (such as inclement weather or an icy surface), or when the character is driving during a dramatic situation (the character is being chased or attacked, for example, or is trying to reach a destination in a limited amount of time). When driving, the character can attempt simple maneuvers or stunts. See Driving a Vehicle for more details.

**Try Again?:** Most driving checks have consequences for failure that make trying again impossible.

**Special:** A character can take 10 when driving, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Vehicle Expert feat gets a +2 bonus on all Drive checks.

There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose motor vehicle. Other types of motor vehicles (heavy wheeled, powerboat, sailboat, ship, and tracked) require the corresponding Surface Vehicle Operation feat, or the character takes a –4 penalty on Drive checks.

**Time:** A Drive check is a move action.

## Escape Artist (Dex) Armor Penalty

**Check:** Make a check to escape from restraints or to squeeze through a tight space.

|Restraint|DC|
|-------|:--:|
|Ropes|Opponent’s Dex check +20|
|Net|20|
|Handcuffs|35|
|Tight space|30|
|Grappler|Opponent’s grapple check|

For ropes, a character’s Escape Artist check is opposed by the Dexterity check result of the opponent who tied the bonds. Since it’s easier to tie someone up than to escape from being tied up, the opponent gets a +20 bonus on his or her Dexterity check.

For a tight space, a check is only called for if the character’s head fits but his or her shoulders don’t. If the space is long, such as in an airshaft, the GM may call for multiple checks. A character can’t fit through a space that his or her head doesn’t fit through.

A character can make an Escape Artist check opposed by his or her opponent’s grapple check to get out of a grapple or out of a pinned condition (so that the character is just being grappled). Doing so is an attack action, so if the character escapes the grapple he or she can move in the same round.

**Try Again?:** A character can make another check after a failed check if the character is squeezing through a tight space, making multiple checks. If the situation permits, the character can make additional checks as long as he or she is not being actively opposed.

**Special:** A character can take 10 on an Escape Artist check. A character can take 20 if he or she is not being actively opposed (a character can take 20 if he or she is tied up, even though it’s an opposed check, because the opponent isn’t actively opposing the character).

A character with the Nimble feat gets a +2 bonus on all Escape Artist checks.

**Time:** Making a check to escape from being bound by ropes, handcuffs, or other restraints (except a grappler) requires 1 minute. Escaping a net is a full-round action. Squeezing through a tight space takes at least 1 minute, maybe longer, depending on the distance that must be crossed.

## Forgery (Int)

**Check:** Forgery requires ma-terials appropriate to the document being forged, and some time. To forge a document the character needs to have seen a similar document before.  The complexity of the document, the character’s degree of familiarity with it, and whether the character needs to reproduce the signature or handwriting of a specific individual, provide modifiers to the Forgery check, as shown below.

|Factor|Check Modifier|Time|
|------|:------------:|----|
|Document Type|||
|Simple (typed letter, business card)|+0|10 min|
|Moderate (letterhead, business form)|–2|20 min|
|Complex (stock certificate, driver’s license)|–4|1 hr.|
|Difficult (passport)|–8|4 hr.|
|Extreme (military/law enforcement ID)|–16|24 hr.|
|Familiarity|||
|Unfamiliar (seen once for less than a minute)|–4||
|Fairly familiar (seen for several minutes)|+0||
|Quite familiar (on hand, or studied at leisure)|+4||
|Forger has produced other documents of same type|+4||
|Document includes specific signature|–4||

Some documents require security or authorization codes, whether authentic ones or additional forgeries. The GM makes the character’s check secretly so the character is not sure how good his or her forgery is.

The Forgery skill is also used to detect someone else’s forgery. The result of the original Forgery check that created the document is opposed by a Forgery check by the person who examines the document to check its authenticity. If the examiner’s check result is equal to or higher than the original Forgery check, the document is determined to be fraudulent. The examiner gains bonuses or penalties on his or her check as given in the table below.

|Condition|Examiner’s Check Modifier|
|---------|:-----------------------:|
|Type of document unknown to examiner|–4|
|Type of document somewhat known to examiner|–2|
|Type of document well known to examiner|+0|
|Document is put through additional tests\*|+4|
|Examiner only casually reviews the document\*|–2|

\* Cumulative with any of the first three conditions on the table. Apply this modifier along with one of the other three whenever appropriate.

A document that contradicts procedure, orders, or previous knowledge, or one that requires the examiner to relinquish a possession or a piece of information, can increase the examiner’s suspicion (and thus create favorable circumstances for the examiner’s opposed Forgery check).

**Try Again?:** No, since the forger isn’t sure of the quality of the original forgery.

**Special:** To forge documents and detect for-geries, one must be able to read and write the -language in question. (The skill is language--dependent.)

A character can take 10 when making a Forgery check, but can’t take 20.

A character with the Meticulous feat gets a +2 bonus on all Forgery checks.

A character without a forgery kit takes a –4 penalty on Forgery checks.

**Time:** Forging a short, simple document takes about 1 minute. Longer or more complex documents take 1d4 minutes per page or longer.

## Gamble (Wis)

**Check:** To join or start a game, a character must first pay a stake. The character sets the purchase DC of the stake if he or she starts the game, or the GM sets it if the character joins a game. Stakes run from penny-ante (purchase DC 4) to astronomical (purchase DC 24). A character cannot take 20 when purchasing a stake.

If the stake is within the character’s means (it is equal to or less than his or her Wealth bonus), the character stands no chance of winning any significant amount. The character might come out ahead, but the amount is not enough to affect his or her Wealth bonus. Since paying the stake didn’t cost any points of Wealth bonus, the character doesn’t lose anything either.

If the stake is higher than the character’s Wealth bonus (before applying any reductions from purchasing the stake), the character gets a +1 bonus on his or her Gamble check for every point the purchase DC is above the character’s Wealth bonus.

The character’s Gamble check is opposed by the Gamble checks of all other participants in the game. (If playing at a casino, assume the house has a Gamble skill modifier equal to the stake purchase DC. Regardless of the stake purchase DC, the house does not get a bonus on its Gamble check for the purchase DC.) If there are many characters participating, the GM can opt to make a single roll for all of them, using the highest Gamble skill modifier among them and adding a +2 bonus to the check.

If the character beats all other participants, he or she wins and gains an increase to his or her Wealth bonus. The amount of the increase depends on the difference between the character’s check result and the next highest result among the other participants.

|Check Result Difference|Wealth Bonus Increase|
|-----------------------|:-------------------:|
|1–9|+1|
|10–19|+2|
|20–29|+3|
|30-–39|+4|
|40 or more|+5|

**Try Again?:** No, unless the character wants to put up another stake.

**Special:** A character can’t take 10 or take 20 when making a Gamble check.

A character with the Confident feat gets a +2 bonus on all Gamble checks.

**Time:** A Gamble check requires 1 hour.
