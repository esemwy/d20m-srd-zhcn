# 载具的移动与战斗

如果只涉及点到点的旅行，载具的使用只与个人风格和和经济相关。只有在特殊情况下才用到技能检定。本文提到的规则主要面向地面载具——小汽车、卡车以及轻型军用载具。稍加改动，本规则也可用于船只、重型武装载具以及飞行器。

## 载具里的角色

角色在载具中通常担任一到多个职能，这决定了角色能做的事情。

**驾驶员：** 载具的驾驶员控制载具的移动。大多数载具只拥有一个驾驶位，乘坐在驾驶位的就是驾驶员。驾驶载具，至少消耗一个移动动作，也就是说驾驶员可以在驾驶中用一个攻击动作做别的事情。一个载具只能同时有一个驾驶员。

**副驾驶：** 副驾驶能够通过`协助他人`行动帮助驾驶员。副驾驶必须位于能看见路面且能协助驾驶员的位置（在小汽车里，通常指的是前乘客座）。协助驾驶员是一个移动动作，副驾驶每轮只剩一个攻击动作来做别的事情。一个载具只能同时拥有一个副驾驶位。如果驾驶员不能或不想驾驶，副驾驶可以代替驾驶员驾驶，前提是副驾驶位也有一套控制系统（常见于飞行器，而非地面载具）。

**射击手：** 一些载具有内置的武器。如果武器的控制系统在驾驶位以外的位置，角色可以坐在那个位置上担任射击手。一个载具有多少个射击手位，就可以有多少个射击手。

**乘员：** 所有登上载具的其他人为乘员。乘员在载具中没有任何需要担任的工作，但可以在载具中向外射击或者做其他动作。

## 尺度

本规则使用两套尺度。如果遭遇战是涉及载具与徒步的角色的，应用角色尺度。如果这是只有载具的场景，且载具的移动速度远高于角色或生物的徒步移动，则应用追逐尺度。

**角色尺度：** 角色尺度与标准的移动尺度相同，都是在5尺见方的方格组成的棋盘内进行。角色尺度中，大多数载具都十分巨大，在地图上占据着多个方格。一个载具占据多少方格见载具描述。

载具的移动，以载具的后悬挂位置为载具的真实位置。载具的转向也是以后悬挂为轴，向目标方向旋转。武器开火的起始位置则在武器所在方格。

在角色尺度中，多个载具不能占据同一个方格。

**追逐尺度：** 在追逐尺度中，每个方格代表50尺见方。

追逐尺度中的大多数载具只占据一个方格。（一些特别巨大的载具，例如大型舰艇或者大型喷气客机，会占据多个方格。）一个方格可以由多个载具占据。在同一方格内的载具，视为相距20尺，用于判断攻击距离。

## 载具体型

载具的体型与角色和生物的体型属同一范畴，见`表：载具体型`。载具的体型调整值应用于先攻调整值、机动调整值以及防御值。（体型调整值已经在`表：载具`中列出）

**表：载具体型**

|载具体型|体型调整值|范例|
|------------|:-----------:|--------|
|超巨型|–8|游艇、牵引车带半挂车|
|巨型|–4|坦克、豪华轿车|
|超大型|–2|奢侈型汽车、SUV、武装汽车|
|大型|–1|经适车、哈雷|
|普通|+0|竞赛摩托车、越野摩托车|

## 朝向与射击角度

不像角色间的战斗，计算载具的战斗时，载具的朝向也很重要。载具朝向的方向就是载具要移动的方向（假设不考虑载具倒车）。朝向同样也决定了载具武器能否瞄准目标。

武器在载具中可以搭载在固定射击位，朝向四个方向——前后左右——或者搭载在半方向炮塔或全方向炮塔上。半方向炮塔可以在相邻的三个方向内自由转动（比如前左右），全方向炮塔则可以向任何方向射击。对于自带武器的载具，武器的射击角已在载具描述中给出。

## 起步

大多数载具都可以以一个移动动作进入，再以一个移动动作启动。例外的载具规则将在载具的描述中提及。

## 先攻

载具战斗的先攻有两种计算方式。第一种是按角色计，像常规战斗一样，每个角色分别计算先攻。这适用于大多数或所有角色都在同一辆载具上的情况，但也会导致乘员为了等待驾驶员机动反应而产生大量延迟或准备动作。另一种则是按载具计，使用载具的先攻调整值。这适用于角色分别在不同的载具上的情况，让同一辆车的所有人的动作顺序彼此接近。

## 载具速度

载具的速度表现为五个档次：静止、巷速、街速、高速、极速。每档速度代表各自的可移动距离（见表：载具速度与调整值）。载具每一轮移动的距离都限定在其当前的速度档次所规定的范围内。

**表：载具速度与调整值**

|速度档次|角色尺度的移动距离\*|角色尺度的转向距离\*\*|追逐尺度的移动距离\*|追逐尺度的转向距离\*\*|防御调整值|检定/掷骰调整值|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|静止\*\*\*|0|—|0|—|+0|—|
|巷速|1–20|1|1–2|1|+0|+0|
|街速|21–50|2|3–5|1|+1|–1|
|高速|51–150|4|6–15|2|+2|–2|
|极速|151+|8|16+|2|+4|–4|

\* 在这个速度下，载具所能移动的方格数。

\*\* 在这个速度下，载具在转向前至少需要径直移动的方格数。

\*\*\* 静止的载具不能移动或做机动动作。

## 宣示速度

在驾驶员行动开始前，驾驶员必须宣示所驾驶载具在本轮的速度档次。驾驶员在前一轮的末尾可以选择提升一档或降低一档所驾驶载具的速度档次。静止的载具可以转为以巷速正向移动或倒车，大多数载具的倒车速度不能超过巷速。

**静止：** 载具完全静止。

**巷速：** 该速度用于在狭小的空间里安全地机动，例如在小巷中或者在停车场中停车。巷速最快与正常人奔跑的速度相当。

**街速：** 载具以中等的速度运动，上限为56千米（35英里）每小时。

**高速：** 载具在标准的公路上的移动速度，从56千米（35英里）每小时到129千米（80英里）每小时。

**极速：** 载具以极快的速度运动，在129千米（80英里）每小时以上。
> 译者按：这些都是游戏规则在现实中的代表，应该按照中国国情酌情划分每个档次所代表的速度范围。

## 移动

在轮到驾驶员行动时，驾驶员可以驾驶载具移动一定的方格数，可移动的距离限定在载具当前速度档次所规定的距离区间内。

载具不像角色那样可以加速移动、奔跑以及做其他可以延长移动距离的动作（除了提升速度档次）。

每种载具都有最高速度，在`表：载具`中有所列举。载具不能移动超过其最高速度的距离。这意味着有的载具不能以极速移动，甚至不能以高速移动。

载具的方格计数方式与角色相同。载具可以斜向移动，但要注意当载具斜向移动时，每两次斜向移动会多算一个方格数（移动两个斜向方格视为移动三个方格）。不同于角色，载具的朝向也是很重要的；除非转向，载具永远只能向面朝的方向移动（或者在倒车模式下向反方向移动）。

## 速度的效果

快速移动的载具比慢速的载具更难被命中——也更难控制，更难命中。

像`表：载具速度与调整值`中列出的那样，载具的速度大于等于街速时，防御会获得加值。但是，该速度也会为载具上所有角色的技能检定和攻击骰带来减值——包括控制载具以及发动攻击所需的驾驶技能检定。

## 驾驶载具

驾驶载具是一个移动动作，由载具的驾驶员进行。在轮到驾驶员行动时，驾驶员可以驾驶载具移动一定的方格数，可移动的距离限定在载具当前速度档次所规定的距离区间内。驾驶员可以试图`机动`以改变载具的路线或速度。载具在路径上的任何一点都可以机动。驾驶员可以额外再尝试一次机动，这需要一个攻击动作。

载具移动有两种类型，简单机动和特技。

**简单机动：** 容易做出的操作即简单机动，如45度角旋转。这些都是即时动作，驾驶员在一次移动中可以做多次简单机动。但是，简单机动仍然要花费移动距离——这意味着载具频繁转向所能移动的距离不如径直移动。简单机动不需要驾驶员做技能检定。

**特技：** 特技相对来说更困难，有时可以通过特技来猛然加速或者以更小的角度转向，这是简单机动所做不到的。特技是一个移动动作。用特技来操控载具需要一个移动动作，而再次使用特技则需要一个攻击动作。特技都需要做驾驶检定。

## 简单机动

载具移动时，驾驶员可以执行以下简单机动。

**45度转向：** 任何载具都能做简单的45度转向，45度转向也是一种移动。载具在转向前必须向前移动等同于`转向距离`数量的方格数（如`表：载具速度与调整值`所示）。执行一次45度转向耗费一格移动距离。

**冲撞：** 角色尺度下，驾驶员无需“发动”冲撞来撞上另一辆载具——只需要驾驶载具移动到另一个载具占据的方格，就会发生碰撞（见`碰撞与冲撞`一节）。

但是在追逐尺度下，同一个方格可以存在多个载具而不发生碰撞——这时则需要以一个简单机动对另一辆载具发动冲撞。驾驶员需要将载具驾驶到另一辆载具所在的方格，并宣布发动冲撞。冲撞按照碰撞的规则结算，不同的是目标载具的驾驶员可以做一个反射豁免（DC15）以使碰撞的双方载具承受的伤害减半。

**侧闪：** 驾驶员可以无需改变朝向而改变路径，例如变道。这种简单机动叫做“侧闪”，侧闪可以让载具避开障碍物，无需改变朝向地在车流中穿梭。侧闪会让载具向左前或右前移动一格，耗费3格移动距离。

## 特技

特技是需要驾驶检定成功才能发动的机动。失败的特技动作常常会导致载具被逼停在目标以外的位置。此时，载具会与路径上的任何物体相碰撞。注意`表：载具速度与调整值`中的检定/掷骰调整值对驾驶员做出的所有驾驶检定以及载具上所有人的攻击骰有效。

**避险：** 极其平坦且无特点的平原很少需要进入载具战斗。当载具试图穿过有险情的方格时，驾驶员必须做一次驾驶检定，成功了才能规避险情，继续移动。

结构是不能用避险来规避的。而且，如果驾驶员不能做检定（如果驾驶员在本回合内做过了多次特技动作，用光了所有的行动机会），此次避险必然失败。如果避险失败，将会发生`碰撞`。

规避险情所需的DC取决于险情的性质。

检定失败，载具将撞上障碍物。如果障碍物是铁蒺藜，铁蒺藜将对载具造成一次攻击（见`铁蒺藜`条目）。浮油会强制驾驶员做一次驾驶检定（DC15）以维持对载具的控制（见`失控`条目）。若规避物品失败，载具将会与物品发生碰撞（见`碰撞与冲撞`）。

|险情|DC|
|-----|:-:|
|铁蒺藜|15|
|浮油|15|
|||
|物品||
|小型（轮胎、碎片）|5|
|普通（板条箱）|10|
|大型（残骸堆）|15|
|||
|结构|不可规避|

**Bootleg Turn:** By making a bootleg turn, a driver can radically change direction without turning in a loop. However, in so doing, the vehicle comes to a stop.

Before a vehicle can make a bootleg turn, it must move in a straight line at least a number of squares equal to its turn number. To make a bootleg turn, simply change the vehicle’s facing to the desired direction. The vehicle ends its movement in that location, at stationary speed.

The DC for a bootleg turn depends on the change in facing.

On a failed check, instead of facing the desired direction, the vehicle only changes facing by 45 degrees. Make a Drive check to retain control against a DC equal to the DC for the bootleg turn attempted (see Losing Control).

|Facing Change|DC|
|------------|:-:|
|45 degrees|5|
|90 degrees|10|
|135 degrees|15|
|180 degrees|20|

**Dash:** With a dash stunt, a driver can increase the vehicle’s speed by one category. (This increase is in addition to any speed change made at the beginning of the driver’s action; if the driver increased speed at that time, he or she can accelerate a total of two categories in the same round.) The vehicle’s total movement for the round cannot exceed the maximum number of squares for its new speed category. (The squares it has already moved before attempting the dash count against this total.)

The DC for a dash is 15. The driver can only succeed at one dash per round.

On a failed check, the vehicle does not change speed categories.

**Hard Brake:** With a hard brake stunt, a driver can reduce the vehicle’s speed by up to two categories. (This is in addition to any speed change made at the beginning of his action; if the driver reduced speed at that time, he or she can drop a total of three categories in the same round.) The vehicle’s movement for the round ends as soon as it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category. (If it has already moved that far before attempting the hard brake, it ends its movement immediately.)

The DC for a hard brake is 15.  The driver can only succeed at one hard break per round.

On a failed check, the vehicle does not change speed categories. Make a Drive check (DC 15) to retain control (see Losing Control).

**Hard Turn:** A hard turn allows a vehicle to make a turn in a short distance without losing speed.

A hard turn functions like a 45-degree turn simple maneuver, except that the vehicle only needs to move forward a number of squares equal to half its turn number (rounded down).

The DC for a hard turn is 15.

On a failed check, the vehicle continues to move forward a number of squares equal to its turn number before turning, just as with a simple 45-degree turn. Make a Drive check (DC 15) to retain control (see Losing Control).

**Jump:** A driver can attempt to jump his or her vehicle across a gap in his or her path.

To make a jump, the vehicle must move in a straight line a number of squares equal to its turn number. If the vehicle doesn’t have enough movement left to clear the gap, it must complete the jump at the start of its next turn.

The DC for a jump depends on the width of the gap, modified by the vehicle’s speed category.

On a failed check, the vehicle fails to clear the gap, and instead falls into it (or collides with the far side). Determine damage as for a collision (see Collisions and Ramming).

|Gap Width|DC|
|--------|:-:|
|1–3 ft. (ditch)|15|
|4–8 ft. (culvert)|20|
|8–15 ft. (creek, small ravine)|25|
|16–25 ft. (narrow road, small pond)|35|
|26–40 ft. (wide road, small river)|45|

|Vehicle Speed Category|DC Modifier|
|----------------------|:---------:|
|Alley speed|+10|
|Street speed|+5|
|Highway speed|+0|
|All-out|–5|

A shallow gap (1 to 3 feet deep) is equivalent to a Medium-size object; the vehicle may be able to avoid taking collision damage from the failed jump by treating the far side as a hazard and then continue moving (see Avoid Hazard, above).

A moderately deep gap (4 to 10 feet deep) is equivalent to a Huge object. The vehicle can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

A deeper gap (11 feet or deeper) is equivalent to a Colossal object. The vehicle can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

If the gap is filled with water, the vehicle takes only half damage from the collision with the ground. However, if the water is too deep or the bottom is too soft (GM’s discretion), the vehicle might not be able to move.

**Sideswipe:** During a vehicle’s movement, a driver can attempt to sideswipe a vehicle or other target, either to deal damage without fully ramming it or to cause another driver to lose control of his or her vehicle.

At character scale, a vehicle must be side by side with its target (that is, occupying the square or squares directly to its side) and moving in the same direction. Attempting a sideswipe costs 1 square of movement.

At chase scale, the vehicle must be in the same square as its target and moving in the same direction. There is no movement cost.

If the stunt is successful, the sideswiping vehicle and the target both take damage as if they had collided (see Collisions and Ramming), except that the collision multiplier is 1/4, and the target (or driver of the target vehicle) can make a Reflex save (DC 15) to reduce the damage to both by half. If the target is another vehicle the driver must succeed at a Drive check (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or lose control of the vehicle.

The DC for a sideswipe is 15. It’s modified by the relative size and speed of the target.

|Target Condition|DC Modifier|
|----------------|:---------:|
|Each size category larger|–5|
|Each size category smaller|+5|
|Each speed category of difference|–2|

On a failed check, both vehicles take damage as though the sideswipe attempt was a success. However, the other driver does not need to make a check to retain control.

## Driver Options

Here is what a vehicle driver can do in a single round:

**Choose the Vehicle’s Speed:** The driver may increase or decrease his or her vehicle’s speed category by one (or keep it the same).

**Optional Attack Action:** If the driver wants, he or she can use his or her attack action before moving the vehicle. If the driver does so, however, he or she will be limited to a single stunt during movement.

**Movement:** Move the vehicle any number of squares within the vehicle’s speed category. Along the way, perform any number of simple maneuvers (limited only by their movement cost). The driver may also attempt a single stunt as part of the movement (or two, if the driver didn’t take his or her attack action before moving).

**Optional Attack Action:** If the driver did not take an attack action before moving, and performed one or fewer stunts, the driver has an attack action left.

## Collisions and Ramming

A collision occurs when a vehicle strikes another vehicle or a solid object. Generally, when a vehicle collides with a creature or other moving vehicle, the target can attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reduce the damage by half.

## Resolving Collisions

The base damage dealt by a vehicle collision depends on the speed and size of the objects involved. Use the highest speed and the smallest size of the two colliding objects and refer to Table: Collision Damage.

**Table: Collision Damage**

|Highest Speed|Damage Die Type|
|-------------|:-------------:|
|Alley speed|d2|
|Street speed|d4|
|Highway speed|d8|
|All-out|d12|

|Smallest Object or Creature Size|Number of Dice|
|--------------------------------|:------------:|
|Colossal|20|
|Gargantuan|16|
|Huge|12|
|Large|8|
|Medium-size|4|
|Small|2|
|Tiny|1|
|Smaller than Tiny|0|

After finding the base damage, determine the collision’s damage multiplier based on how the colliding vehicle struck the other vehicle or object. (For vehicles moving in reverse, consider the back end to be the vehicle’s “front” for determining the collision multiplier.) Consult Table: Collision Direction for a multiplier.

Once the damage has been determined, apply it to both vehicles (or objects or creatures) involved in the collision. Both vehicles reduce their speed by two speed categories. If the colliding vehicle moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category before the collision, it ends its movement immediately. If not, it pushes the other vehicle or object aside, if possible, and continues until it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category.

**Table: Collision Direction**

|Colliding Vehicle’s Target|Multiplier|
|--------------------------|:--------:|
|A stationary object|x 1|
|A moving vehicle, striking head-on or 45 degrees from head-on|x 2|
|A moving vehicle, striking perpendicular|x 1|
|A moving vehicle, striking from the rear or 45 degrees from the rear|x 1/2|
|A vehicle being sideswiped (see Sideswipe)|x 1/4|

The driver of the vehicle that caused the collision must immediately make a Drive check (DC 15) or lose control of the vehicle (see Losing Control, below). The driver of the other vehicle must succeed on a Drive check (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or lose control of his or her vehicle.

## Damage to Vehicle Occupants

When a vehicle takes damage from a collision, its occupants may take damage as well. The base amount of damage depends on the cover offered by the vehicle.

|Cover|Damage|
|-----|------|
|None|Same as damage taken by vehicle|
|One-quarter|One-half damage taken by vehicle|
|One-half|One-quarter damage taken by vehicle|
|Three-quarters or more|None|

Each of the occupants may make a Reflex save (DC 15) to take half damage.

## Losing Control

A collision or a failed stunt can cause a driver to lose control of his vehicle. In these cases, the driver must make a Drive check to retain control of the vehicle. If this check is successful, the driver maintains control of the vehicle. If it fails, the vehicle goes into a spin. If it fails by 10 or more, the vehicle rolls. Remember that the check/roll modifier from Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers applies to all Drive checks.

An out-of-control vehicle may strike an object or other vehicle. When that happens, a collision occurs (see Collisions and Ramming, above).

**Spin:** The vehicle skids, spinning wildly.

At character scale, the vehicle moves in its current direction a number of squares equal to the turn number for its speed, then ends its movement. Once it stops, roll 1d8 to determine its new facing: 1, no change; 2, right 45 degrees; 3, right 90 degrees; 4, right 135 degrees; 5, 180 degrees; 6, left 135 degrees; 7, left 90 degrees; 8, left 45 degrees. Reorient the vehicle accordingly.

At chase scale, the vehicle moves 1 square and ends its movement. Roll to determine its new facing as indicated above.

**Roll:** The vehicle tumbles, taking damage.

At character scale, the vehicle rolls in a straight line in its current direction for a number of squares equal to the turn number for its speed, then ends its movement. At the end of the vehicle’s roll, reorient the vehicle perpendicular to its original direction of travel (determine left or right randomly).

At chase scale, the vehicle rolls one square before stopping and reorienting.

At either scale, a vehicle takes damage equal to 2d6 x the character scale turn number for its speed (use the turn number from character scale even at chase scale). The vehicle’s occupants take damage equal to 2d4 x the character scale turn number for its speed (Reflex save, DC 15, for half damage).

## Hide and Seek

When being pursued, a driver can attempt a Hide check to lose the pursuer in heavy traffic, or a Bluff check to misdirect the pursuer before turning onto an off-ramp or a side street.

To make a Hide check, use the normal rules for hiding (see the Hide skill description). The normal size modifiers apply, but because the driver is hiding among other vehicles, most of which are size Large or Huge, he or she gains a +8 bonus on the check. This use of the Hide skill can only be attempted in fairly heavy traffic; in lighter traffic, the GM might not allow it or might apply a penalty to the check.

A driver can use Bluff to make a pursuer think he or she is going a different direction from what the driver intends. Just before making a turn onto an off-ramp or side street, make a Bluff check opposed by the pursuer’s Sense Motive check. If the driver is successful, the pursuer takes a –5 penalty on any Drive check needed to make the turn to follow the driver. If the other driver can make the turn using only simple maneuvers and does not have to make a Drive check, the Bluff attempt has no effect.

## Fighting from Vehicles

The following rules provide a further framework for combat involving vehicles.

## Vehicle Combat Actions

Actions during vehicle combat are handled the same way as actions during personal combat. In general, a character can take two move actions, one move action and one attack action, or one full-round action in a round. Free actions can be performed normally, in conjunction with another action.

**Free Actions:** Communicating orders is a free action. Characters can perform as many free actions as the GM permits in a single round.

**Move Actions:** Changing position within a vehicle is usually a move action, especially if the character has to trade places with another character. If the character’s movement is short and unobstructed, the character can do it as the equivalent of a 5-foot step. Otherwise, it requires a move action.

**Attack Actions:** Anyone aboard a vehicle can make an attack with a personal weapon, and drivers and gunners can make attacks with any vehicle-mounted weapons controlled from their positions.

**Full-Round Actions:** Since the driver must use a move action to control the vehicle, he or she can’t take a full-round action unless he or she starts it in one round and completes it on his or her next turn (see Start/Complete Full-Round Action).

## Crew Quality

Rather than force the GM to create, or remember, statistics for everyone aboard a vehicle, vehicle statistics include a general “crew quality” descriptor. This indicates a typical crew’s aptitude with the vehicle’s systems.

Table: Vehicle Crew Quality shows the five levels of crew quality for GM-controlled vehicle crews, along with the appropriate check modifier. Use the check modifier for all skill checks related to the operation of the vehicle (including Drive and Repair checks). Use the attack bonus for all attack rolls performed by the crew. For quick reference, Table: Crewed Vehicles shows the typical crew quality, and the crew’s total initiative and maneuver modifiers, for the vehicles covered in this book.

This by no means restricts the GM from creating unique vehicles where the crew’s statistics are included, or from using GM characters’ abilities when they drive or attack from vehicles. It’s merely a shortcut to save time if the GM doesn’t have particular characters behind the wheel.

## Attack Options

Firing a vehicle’s weapon requires an attack action and uses the driver’s or gunner’s ranged attack modifier.

A driver with 5 or more ranks in the Drive skill gains a +2 synergy bonus when firing vehicle-mounted weapons while driving.

Some military vehicles are equipped with fire-control computers. These systems grant equipment bonuses on attack rolls with the vehicle-mounted weapons to which they apply.


**Driving Defensively:** Just as in melee combat, one can fight defensively while driving a vehicle, which grants a +2 dodge bonus to the vehicle’s Defense and applies a –4 penalty on attack rolls made by occupants of the vehicle.

**Total Defense:** A driver can choose the total defense, action which grants a +4 dodge bonus to Defense but does not allow the driver to attack (gunners or passengers take a –8 penalty on attack rolls). These modifiers last until the driver’s next round of actions.

**Full Attack Action:** A driver cannot normally make a full attack, since controlling the vehicle requires a move action.

Gunners or passengers, however, can take full attack actions, since they don’t have to use a move action (except, perhaps, to change positions in the vehicle). In general, taking a full attack action is useful only if a character has a base attack bonus high enough to get multiple attacks. A passenger can make multiple attacks with his or her own weapon. A gunner can make multiple attacks with one or more weapons controlled from his or her position.

## Targeting Occupants

An attack made against a vehicle uses the vehicle’s Defense, modified by its speed category. Attackers can choose instead to target specific vehicle occupants.

An attack against a vehicle occupant is made like any other attack. Remember, however, that a character in a vehicle gains bonuses to Defense from both the vehicle’s speed and any cover it provides.

## Cover

When a character fires from a vehicle, objects or other vehicles in the way can provide cover for the target.

## Damaging Vehicles

All vehicles have hit points, which are roughly equivalent to a character’s hit points. Like most inanimate objects, vehicles also have hardness. Whenever a vehicle takes damage, subtract the vehicle’s hardness from the damage dealt.

When a vehicle is reduced to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Although it might be repairable, it ceases functioning. A vehicle that is disabled while moving drops one speed category each round until it comes to a stop. The driver cannot attempt any maneuvers except a 45-degree turn.

Unlike characters, vehicles don’t “die” when they reach –10 hit points. Instead, a vehicle is destroyed when it loses hit points equal to twice its full normal total. A destroyed vehicle cannot be repaired.

**Energy Attacks:** Vehicles are treated as objects when subjected to energy attacks.

**Exploding Vehicles:** If the attack that disables a vehicle deals damage equal to half its full normal hit points or more, the vehicle explodes after 1d6 rounds. This explosion deals 10d6 points of fire damage to everyone within the vehicle (Reflex save, DC 20, for half damage), and half that much to everyone and everything within 30 feet of the explosion (Reflex save, DC 15, for half damage).

## Repairing Damage

Repairing damage to a vehicle takes a full hour of work, a mechanical tool kit, and a garage or some other suitable facility. (Without the tool kit, a character takes a –4 penalty on his or her Repair check.) At the end of the hour, make a Repair check (DC 20). 若成功则恢复2d6生命值。If damage remains, the character may continue to make repairs for as many hours as it takes to restore all of the vehicle’s hit points.
