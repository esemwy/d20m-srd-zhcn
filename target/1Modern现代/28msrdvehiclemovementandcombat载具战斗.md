# 载具的移动与战斗

如果只涉及点到点的旅行，载具的使用只与个人风格和和经济相关。只有在特殊情况下才用到技能检定。本文提到的规则主要面向地面载具——小汽车、卡车以及轻型军用载具。稍加改动，本规则也可用于船只、重型武装载具以及飞行器。

## 载具里的角色

角色在载具中通常担任一到多个职能，这决定了角色能做的事情。

**驾驶员：** 载具的驾驶员控制载具的移动。大多数载具只拥有一个驾驶位，乘坐在驾驶位的就是驾驶员。驾驶载具，至少消耗一个移动动作，也就是说驾驶员可以在驾驶中用一个攻击动作做别的事情。一个载具只能同时有一个驾驶员。

**副驾驶：** 副驾驶能够通过`协助他人`行动帮助驾驶员。副驾驶必须位于能看见路面且能协助驾驶员的位置（在小汽车里，通常指的是前乘客座）。协助驾驶员是一个移动动作，副驾驶每轮只剩一个攻击动作来做别的事情。一个载具只能同时拥有一个副驾驶位。如果驾驶员不能或不想驾驶，副驾驶可以代替驾驶员驾驶，前提是副驾驶位也有一套控制系统（常见于飞行器，而非地面载具）。

**射击手：** 一些载具有内置的武器。如果武器的控制系统在驾驶位以外的位置，角色可以坐在那个位置上担任射击手。一个载具有多少个射击手位，就可以有多少个射击手。

**乘员：** 所有登上载具的其他人为乘员。乘员在载具中没有任何需要担任的工作，但可以在载具中向外射击或者做其他动作。

## 尺度

本规则使用两套尺度。如果遭遇战是涉及载具与徒步的角色的，应用角色尺度。如果这是只有载具的场景，且载具的移动速度远高于角色或生物的徒步移动，则应用追逐尺度。

**角色尺度：** 角色尺度与标准的移动尺度相同，都是在5尺见方的方格组成的棋盘内进行。角色尺度中，大多数载具都十分巨大，在地图上占据着多个方格。一个载具占据多少方格见载具描述。

载具的移动，以载具的后悬挂位置为载具的真实位置。载具的转向也是以后悬挂为轴，向目标方向旋转。武器开火的起始位置则在武器所在方格。

在角色尺度中，多个载具不能占据同一个方格。

**追逐尺度：** 在追逐尺度中，每个方格代表50尺见方。

追逐尺度中的大多数载具只占据一个方格。（一些特别巨大的载具，例如大型舰艇或者大型喷气客机，会占据多个方格。）一个方格可以由多个载具占据。在同一方格内的载具，视为相距20尺，用于判断攻击距离。

## 载具体型

载具的体型与角色和生物的体型属同一范畴，见`表：载具体型`。载具的体型调整值应用于先攻调整值、机动调整值以及防御值。（体型调整值已经在`表：载具`中列出）

**表：载具体型**

|载具体型|体型调整值|范例|
|------------|:-----------:|--------|
|超巨型|–8|游艇、牵引车带半挂车|
|巨型|–4|坦克、豪华轿车|
|超大型|–2|奢侈型汽车、SUV、武装汽车|
|大型|–1|经适车、哈雷|
|普通|+0|竞赛摩托车、越野摩托车|

## 朝向与射击角度

不像角色间的战斗，计算载具的战斗时，载具的朝向也很重要。载具朝向的方向就是载具要移动的方向（假设不考虑载具倒车）。朝向同样也决定了载具武器能否瞄准目标。

武器在载具中可以搭载在固定射击位，朝向四个方向——前后左右——或者搭载在半方向炮塔或全方向炮塔上。半方向炮塔可以在相邻的三个方向内自由转动（比如前左右），全方向炮塔则可以向任何方向射击。对于自带武器的载具，武器的射击角已在载具描述中给出。

## 起步

大多数载具都可以以一个移动动作进入，再以一个移动动作启动。例外的载具规则将在载具的描述中提及。

## 先攻

载具战斗的先攻有两种计算方式。第一种是按角色计，像常规战斗一样，每个角色分别计算先攻。这适用于大多数或所有角色都在同一辆载具上的情况，但也会导致乘员为了等待驾驶员机动反应而产生大量延迟或准备动作。另一种则是按载具计，使用载具的先攻调整值。这适用于角色分别在不同的载具上的情况，让同一辆车的所有人的动作顺序彼此接近。

## 载具速度

载具的速度表现为五个档次：静止、巷速、街速、高速、极速。每档速度代表各自的可移动距离（见表：载具速度与调整值）。载具每一轮移动的距离都限定在其当前的速度档次所规定的范围内。

**表：载具速度与调整值**

|速度档次|角色尺度的移动距离\*|角色尺度的转向距离\*\*|追逐尺度的移动距离\*|追逐尺度的转向距离\*\*|防御调整值|检定/掷骰调整值|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|静止\*\*\*|0|—|0|—|+0|—|
|巷速|1–20|1|1–2|1|+0|+0|
|街速|21–50|2|3–5|1|+1|–1|
|高速|51–150|4|6–15|2|+2|–2|
|极速|151+|8|16+|2|+4|–4|

\* 在这个速度下，载具所能移动的方格数。

\*\* 在这个速度下，载具在转向前至少需要径直移动的方格数。

\*\*\* 静止的载具不能移动或做机动反应。

## 宣示速度

在驾驶员行动开始前，驾驶员必须宣示所驾驶载具在本轮的速度档次。驾驶员在前一轮的末尾可以选择提升一档或降低一档所驾驶载具的速度档次。静止的载具可以转为以巷速正向移动或倒车，大多数载具的倒车速度不能超过巷速。

**静止：** 载具完全静止。

**巷速：** 该速度用于在狭小的空间里安全地机动，例如在小巷中或者在停车场中停车。巷速最快与正常人奔跑的速度相当。

**街速：** 载具以中等的速度运动，上限为56千米（35英里）每小时。

**高速：** 载具在标准的公路上的移动速度，从56千米（35英里）每小时到129千米（80英里）每小时。

**极速：** 载具以极快的速度运动，在129千米（80英里）每小时以上。
> 译者按：这些都是游戏规则在现实中的代表，应该按照中国国情酌情划分每个档次所代表的速度范围。

## Moving

On his or her action, the driver moves the vehicle a number of squares that falls within the vehicle’s speed category.

Unlike characters, a vehicle cannot double move, run, or otherwise extend its movement (except by changing to a higher speed category).

Every vehicle has a top speed, included in its statistics on Table: Vehicles. A vehicle cannot move more squares than its top speed. This means that some vehicles cannot move at all-out speed, or even highway speed.

Count squares for vehicles just as for characters. Vehicles can move diagonally; remember that when moving diagonally, every second square costs two squares’ worth of movement. Unlike with moving characters, a vehicle’s facing is important; unless it changes direction, a vehicle always moves in the direction of its facing (or in the opposite direction, if it’s moving in reverse).

## The Effects of Speed

A fast-moving vehicle is harder to hit than a stationary one—but it’s also harder to control, and to attack from.

As shown on Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers, when a vehicle travels at street speed or faster, it gains a bonus to Defense. However, that speed brings along with it a penalty on all skill checks and attack rolls made by characters aboard the vehicle—including Drive checks to control the vehicle and attacks made from it.

## Driving a Vehicle

Driving a vehicle is a move action, taken by the vehicle’s driver. During his or her move action, the driver moves the vehicle a number of squares that falls within its speed category. The driver can attempt maneuvers to change the vehicle’s course or speed. These maneuvers can be attempted at any point along the vehicle’s route. The driver can choose to use his or her attack action to attempt additional maneuvers.

The two kinds of vehicle movement are simple maneuvers and stunts.

**Simple Maneuvers:** A simple maneuver, such as a 45-degree turn, is easy to perform. Each is a free action and can be taken as many times as the driver likes while he or she moves the vehicle. However, simple maneuvers do cost movement—so a vehicle that makes a lot of simple maneuvers will not get as far as one going in a straight line. Simple maneuvers do not require the driver to make skill checks.

**Stunts:** Stunts are difficult and sometimes daring maneuvers that enable a driver to change his or her vehicle’s speed or heading more radically than a simple maneuver allows. A stunt is a move action. It can be taken as part of a move action to control the vehicle, and a second stunt can be attempted in lieu of the driver’s attack action. Stunts always require Drive checks.

## Simple Maneuvers

During a vehicle’s movement, the driver can perform any one of the following maneuvers.

**45-Degree Turn:** Any vehicle can make a simple 45-degree turn as part of its movement. The vehicle must move forward at least a number of squares equal to its turn number (shown on Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers) before it can turn. Making a 45-degree turn costs 1 square of movement.

**Ram:** At character scale, a driver does not have to perform a maneuver to ram another vehicle—he or she only needs to drive his or her vehicle into the other vehicle’s square, and a collision occurs (see Collisions and Ramming).

At chase scale, however, more than one vehicle can occupy the same square and not collide—so ramming another vehicle requires a simple maneuver. The driver moves his or her vehicle into the other vehicle’s square and states that he or she is attempting to ram. Resolve the ram as a collision, except that the driver of the target vehicle can make a Reflex save (DC 15) to reduce the damage to both vehicles by half.

**Sideslip:** A driver might wish to move to the side without changing the vehicle’s facing, for instance to change lanes. This simple maneuver, called a sideslip, allows a vehicle to avoid obstacles or weave in and out of traffic without changing facing. A sideslip moves a vehicle 1 square forward and 1 square to the right or left, and costs 3 squares of movement.

## Stunts

Stunts are maneuvers that require a Drive check to perform successfully. Unsuccessful stunts often result in the vehicle ending up someplace other than where the driver intended. When this happens, the vehicle collides with any objects in its path. Remember that the check/roll modifier from Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers affects all Drive checks made by the driver and attack rolls made by all occupants of the vehicle.

**Avoid Hazard:** Vehicle combat rarely occurs on a perfectly flat, featureless plain. When a vehicle tries to move through a square occupied by a hazard, the driver must succeed on a Drive check to avoid the hazard and continue moving.

Structures simply cannot be avoided. Also, if a driver cannot make a check (if he or she has used all his or her actions for the round in performing other stunts), he or she automatically fails to avoid the hazard. In such cases, a collision occurs.

The DC to avoid a hazard varies with the nature of the hazard.

On a failed check, the vehicle hits the obstacle. For caltrops, this means the caltrops make an attack against the vehicle (see Caltrops). An oil slick forces the drive to make a Drive check (DC 15) to retain control of the vehicle (see Losing Control). Failing to avoid an object results in a collision with the object (see Collisions and Ramming).

|Hazard|DC|
|-----|:-:|
|Caltrops|15|
|Oil slick|15|
|||
|Object||
|Small (tire, light debris)|5|
|Medium-size (crate)|10|
|Large (pile of wreckage)|15|
|||
|Structure|Cannot be avoided|

**Bootleg Turn:** By making a bootleg turn, a driver can radically change direction without turning in a loop. However, in so doing, the vehicle comes to a stop.

Before a vehicle can make a bootleg turn, it must move in a straight line at least a number of squares equal to its turn number. To make a bootleg turn, simply change the vehicle’s facing to the desired direction. The vehicle ends its movement in that location, at stationary speed.

The DC for a bootleg turn depends on the change in facing.

On a failed check, instead of facing the desired direction, the vehicle only changes facing by 45 degrees. Make a Drive check to retain control against a DC equal to the DC for the bootleg turn attempted (see Losing Control).

|Facing Change|DC|
|------------|:-:|
|45 degrees|5|
|90 degrees|10|
|135 degrees|15|
|180 degrees|20|

**Dash:** With a dash stunt, a driver can increase the vehicle’s speed by one category. (This increase is in addition to any speed change made at the beginning of the driver’s action; if the driver increased speed at that time, he or she can accelerate a total of two categories in the same round.) The vehicle’s total movement for the round cannot exceed the maximum number of squares for its new speed category. (The squares it has already moved before attempting the dash count against this total.)

The DC for a dash is 15. The driver can only succeed at one dash per round.

On a failed check, the vehicle does not change speed categories.

**Hard Brake:** With a hard brake stunt, a driver can reduce the vehicle’s speed by up to two categories. (This is in addition to any speed change made at the beginning of his action; if the driver reduced speed at that time, he or she can drop a total of three categories in the same round.) The vehicle’s movement for the round ends as soon as it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category. (If it has already moved that far before attempting the hard brake, it ends its movement immediately.)

The DC for a hard brake is 15.  The driver can only succeed at one hard break per round.

On a failed check, the vehicle does not change speed categories. Make a Drive check (DC 15) to retain control (see Losing Control).

**Hard Turn:** A hard turn allows a vehicle to make a turn in a short distance without losing speed.

A hard turn functions like a 45-degree turn simple maneuver, except that the vehicle only needs to move forward a number of squares equal to half its turn number (rounded down).

The DC for a hard turn is 15.

On a failed check, the vehicle continues to move forward a number of squares equal to its turn number before turning, just as with a simple 45-degree turn. Make a Drive check (DC 15) to retain control (see Losing Control).

**Jump:** A driver can attempt to jump his or her vehicle across a gap in his or her path.

To make a jump, the vehicle must move in a straight line a number of squares equal to its turn number. If the vehicle doesn’t have enough movement left to clear the gap, it must complete the jump at the start of its next turn.

The DC for a jump depends on the width of the gap, modified by the vehicle’s speed category.

On a failed check, the vehicle fails to clear the gap, and instead falls into it (or collides with the far side). Determine damage as for a collision (see Collisions and Ramming).

|Gap Width|DC|
|--------|:-:|
|1–3 ft. (ditch)|15|
|4–8 ft. (culvert)|20|
|8–15 ft. (creek, small ravine)|25|
|16–25 ft. (narrow road, small pond)|35|
|26–40 ft. (wide road, small river)|45|

|Vehicle Speed Category|DC Modifier|
|----------------------|:---------:|
|Alley speed|+10|
|Street speed|+5|
|Highway speed|+0|
|All-out|–5|

A shallow gap (1 to 3 feet deep) is equivalent to a Medium-size object; the vehicle may be able to avoid taking collision damage from the failed jump by treating the far side as a hazard and then continue moving (see Avoid Hazard, above).

A moderately deep gap (4 to 10 feet deep) is equivalent to a Huge object. The vehicle can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

A deeper gap (11 feet or deeper) is equivalent to a Colossal object. The vehicle can only drive out of the gap if the walls are not too steep.

If the gap is filled with water, the vehicle takes only half damage from the collision with the ground. However, if the water is too deep or the bottom is too soft (GM’s discretion), the vehicle might not be able to move.

**Sideswipe:** During a vehicle’s movement, a driver can attempt to sideswipe a vehicle or other target, either to deal damage without fully ramming it or to cause another driver to lose control of his or her vehicle.

At character scale, a vehicle must be side by side with its target (that is, occupying the square or squares directly to its side) and moving in the same direction. Attempting a sideswipe costs 1 square of movement.

At chase scale, the vehicle must be in the same square as its target and moving in the same direction. There is no movement cost.

If the stunt is successful, the sideswiping vehicle and the target both take damage as if they had collided (see Collisions and Ramming), except that the collision multiplier is 1/4, and the target (or driver of the target vehicle) can make a Reflex save (DC 15) to reduce the damage to both by half. If the target is another vehicle the driver must succeed at a Drive check (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or lose control of the vehicle.

The DC for a sideswipe is 15. It’s modified by the relative size and speed of the target.

|Target Condition|DC Modifier|
|----------------|:---------:|
|Each size category larger|–5|
|Each size category smaller|+5|
|Each speed category of difference|–2|

On a failed check, both vehicles take damage as though the sideswipe attempt was a success. However, the other driver does not need to make a check to retain control.

## Driver Options

Here is what a vehicle driver can do in a single round:

**Choose the Vehicle’s Speed:** The driver may increase or decrease his or her vehicle’s speed category by one (or keep it the same).

**Optional Attack Action:** If the driver wants, he or she can use his or her attack action before moving the vehicle. If the driver does so, however, he or she will be limited to a single stunt during movement.

**Movement:** Move the vehicle any number of squares within the vehicle’s speed category. Along the way, perform any number of simple maneuvers (limited only by their movement cost). The driver may also attempt a single stunt as part of the movement (or two, if the driver didn’t take his or her attack action before moving).

**Optional Attack Action:** If the driver did not take an attack action before moving, and performed one or fewer stunts, the driver has an attack action left.

## Collisions and Ramming

A collision occurs when a vehicle strikes another vehicle or a solid object. Generally, when a vehicle collides with a creature or other moving vehicle, the target can attempt a Reflex save (DC 15) to reduce the damage by half.

## Resolving Collisions

The base damage dealt by a vehicle collision depends on the speed and size of the objects involved. Use the highest speed and the smallest size of the two colliding objects and refer to Table: Collision Damage.

**Table: Collision Damage**

|Highest Speed|Damage Die Type|
|-------------|:-------------:|
|Alley speed|d2|
|Street speed|d4|
|Highway speed|d8|
|All-out|d12|

|Smallest Object or Creature Size|Number of Dice|
|--------------------------------|:------------:|
|Colossal|20|
|Gargantuan|16|
|Huge|12|
|Large|8|
|Medium-size|4|
|Small|2|
|Tiny|1|
|Smaller than Tiny|0|

After finding the base damage, determine the collision’s damage multiplier based on how the colliding vehicle struck the other vehicle or object. (For vehicles moving in reverse, consider the back end to be the vehicle’s “front” for determining the collision multiplier.) Consult Table: Collision Direction for a multiplier.

Once the damage has been determined, apply it to both vehicles (or objects or creatures) involved in the collision. Both vehicles reduce their speed by two speed categories. If the colliding vehicle moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category before the collision, it ends its movement immediately. If not, it pushes the other vehicle or object aside, if possible, and continues until it has moved the minimum number of squares for its new speed category.

**Table: Collision Direction**

|Colliding Vehicle’s Target|Multiplier|
|--------------------------|:--------:|
|A stationary object|x 1|
|A moving vehicle, striking head-on or 45 degrees from head-on|x 2|
|A moving vehicle, striking perpendicular|x 1|
|A moving vehicle, striking from the rear or 45 degrees from the rear|x 1/2|
|A vehicle being sideswiped (see Sideswipe)|x 1/4|

The driver of the vehicle that caused the collision must immediately make a Drive check (DC 15) or lose control of the vehicle (see Losing Control, below). The driver of the other vehicle must succeed on a Drive check (DC 15) at the beginning of his or her next action or lose control of his or her vehicle.

## Damage to Vehicle Occupants

When a vehicle takes damage from a collision, its occupants may take damage as well. The base amount of damage depends on the cover offered by the vehicle.

|Cover|Damage|
|-----|------|
|None|Same as damage taken by vehicle|
|One-quarter|One-half damage taken by vehicle|
|One-half|One-quarter damage taken by vehicle|
|Three-quarters or more|None|

Each of the occupants may make a Reflex save (DC 15) to take half damage.

## Losing Control

A collision or a failed stunt can cause a driver to lose control of his vehicle. In these cases, the driver must make a Drive check to retain control of the vehicle. If this check is successful, the driver maintains control of the vehicle. If it fails, the vehicle goes into a spin. If it fails by 10 or more, the vehicle rolls. Remember that the check/roll modifier from Table: Vehicle Speeds and Modifiers applies to all Drive checks.

An out-of-control vehicle may strike an object or other vehicle. When that happens, a collision occurs (see Collisions and Ramming, above).

**Spin:** The vehicle skids, spinning wildly.

At character scale, the vehicle moves in its current direction a number of squares equal to the turn number for its speed, then ends its movement. Once it stops, roll 1d8 to determine its new facing: 1, no change; 2, right 45 degrees; 3, right 90 degrees; 4, right 135 degrees; 5, 180 degrees; 6, left 135 degrees; 7, left 90 degrees; 8, left 45 degrees. Reorient the vehicle accordingly.

At chase scale, the vehicle moves 1 square and ends its movement. Roll to determine its new facing as indicated above.

**Roll:** The vehicle tumbles, taking damage.

At character scale, the vehicle rolls in a straight line in its current direction for a number of squares equal to the turn number for its speed, then ends its movement. At the end of the vehicle’s roll, reorient the vehicle perpendicular to its original direction of travel (determine left or right randomly).

At chase scale, the vehicle rolls one square before stopping and reorienting.

At either scale, a vehicle takes damage equal to 2d6 x the character scale turn number for its speed (use the turn number from character scale even at chase scale). The vehicle’s occupants take damage equal to 2d4 x the character scale turn number for its speed (Reflex save, DC 15, for half damage).

## Hide and Seek

When being pursued, a driver can attempt a Hide check to lose the pursuer in heavy traffic, or a Bluff check to misdirect the pursuer before turning onto an off-ramp or a side street.

To make a Hide check, use the normal rules for hiding (see the Hide skill description). The normal size modifiers apply, but because the driver is hiding among other vehicles, most of which are size Large or Huge, he or she gains a +8 bonus on the check. This use of the Hide skill can only be attempted in fairly heavy traffic; in lighter traffic, the GM might not allow it or might apply a penalty to the check.

A driver can use Bluff to make a pursuer think he or she is going a different direction from what the driver intends. Just before making a turn onto an off-ramp or side street, make a Bluff check opposed by the pursuer’s Sense Motive check. If the driver is successful, the pursuer takes a –5 penalty on any Drive check needed to make the turn to follow the driver. If the other driver can make the turn using only simple maneuvers and does not have to make a Drive check, the Bluff attempt has no effect.

## Fighting from Vehicles

The following rules provide a further framework for combat involving vehicles.

## Vehicle Combat Actions

Actions during vehicle combat are handled the same way as actions during personal combat. In general, a character can take two move actions, one move action and one attack action, or one full-round action in a round. Free actions can be performed normally, in conjunction with another action.

**Free Actions:** Communicating orders is a free action. Characters can perform as many free actions as the GM permits in a single round.

**Move Actions:** Changing position within a vehicle is usually a move action, especially if the character has to trade places with another character. If the character’s movement is short and unobstructed, the character can do it as the equivalent of a 5-foot step. Otherwise, it requires a move action.

**Attack Actions:** Anyone aboard a vehicle can make an attack with a personal weapon, and drivers and gunners can make attacks with any vehicle-mounted weapons controlled from their positions.

**Full-Round Actions:** Since the driver must use a move action to control the vehicle, he or she can’t take a full-round action unless he or she starts it in one round and completes it on his or her next turn (see Start/Complete Full-Round Action).

## Crew Quality

Rather than force the GM to create, or remember, statistics for everyone aboard a vehicle, vehicle statistics include a general “crew quality” descriptor. This indicates a typical crew’s aptitude with the vehicle’s systems.

Table: Vehicle Crew Quality shows the five levels of crew quality for GM-controlled vehicle crews, along with the appropriate check modifier. Use the check modifier for all skill checks related to the operation of the vehicle (including Drive and Repair checks). Use the attack bonus for all attack rolls performed by the crew. For quick reference, Table: Crewed Vehicles shows the typical crew quality, and the crew’s total initiative and maneuver modifiers, for the vehicles covered in this book.

This by no means restricts the GM from creating unique vehicles where the crew’s statistics are included, or from using GM characters’ abilities when they drive or attack from vehicles. It’s merely a shortcut to save time if the GM doesn’t have particular characters behind the wheel.

## Attack Options

Firing a vehicle’s weapon requires an attack action and uses the driver’s or gunner’s ranged attack modifier.

A driver with 5 or more ranks in the Drive skill gains a +2 synergy bonus when firing vehicle-mounted weapons while driving.

Some military vehicles are equipped with fire-control computers. These systems grant equipment bonuses on attack rolls with the vehicle-mounted weapons to which they apply.


**Driving Defensively:** Just as in melee combat, one can fight defensively while driving a vehicle, which grants a +2 dodge bonus to the vehicle’s Defense and applies a –4 penalty on attack rolls made by occupants of the vehicle.

**Total Defense:** A driver can choose the total defense, action which grants a +4 dodge bonus to Defense but does not allow the driver to attack (gunners or passengers take a –8 penalty on attack rolls). These modifiers last until the driver’s next round of actions.

**Full Attack Action:** A driver cannot normally make a full attack, since controlling the vehicle requires a move action.

Gunners or passengers, however, can take full attack actions, since they don’t have to use a move action (except, perhaps, to change positions in the vehicle). In general, taking a full attack action is useful only if a character has a base attack bonus high enough to get multiple attacks. A passenger can make multiple attacks with his or her own weapon. A gunner can make multiple attacks with one or more weapons controlled from his or her position.

## Targeting Occupants

An attack made against a vehicle uses the vehicle’s Defense, modified by its speed category. Attackers can choose instead to target specific vehicle occupants.

An attack against a vehicle occupant is made like any other attack. Remember, however, that a character in a vehicle gains bonuses to Defense from both the vehicle’s speed and any cover it provides.

## Cover

When a character fires from a vehicle, objects or other vehicles in the way can provide cover for the target.

## Damaging Vehicles

All vehicles have hit points, which are roughly equivalent to a character’s hit points. Like most inanimate objects, vehicles also have hardness. Whenever a vehicle takes damage, subtract the vehicle’s hardness from the damage dealt.

When a vehicle is reduced to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Although it might be repairable, it ceases functioning. A vehicle that is disabled while moving drops one speed category each round until it comes to a stop. The driver cannot attempt any maneuvers except a 45-degree turn.

Unlike characters, vehicles don’t “die” when they reach –10 hit points. Instead, a vehicle is destroyed when it loses hit points equal to twice its full normal total. A destroyed vehicle cannot be repaired.

**Energy Attacks:** Vehicles are treated as objects when subjected to energy attacks.

**Exploding Vehicles:** If the attack that disables a vehicle deals damage equal to half its full normal hit points or more, the vehicle explodes after 1d6 rounds. This explosion deals 10d6 points of fire damage to everyone within the vehicle (Reflex save, DC 20, for half damage), and half that much to everyone and everything within 30 feet of the explosion (Reflex save, DC 15, for half damage).

## Repairing Damage

Repairing damage to a vehicle takes a full hour of work, a mechanical tool kit, and a garage or some other suitable facility. (Without the tool kit, a character takes a –4 penalty on his or her Repair check.) At the end of the hour, make a Repair check (DC 20). 若成功则恢复2d6生命值。If damage remains, the character may continue to make repairs for as many hours as it takes to restore all of the vehicle’s hit points.
