Class Features
The following features pertain to the Arcane Arranger advanced class.
Word on the Street
The Arcane Arranger filters information constantly and remembers everything. Through regular contacts, gossip, internet chats, and other situations, he has a deep knowledge of everyday things. The Arcane Arranger can make a Gather Information check on general or specific information instantaneously, and spends only an hour making a Gather Information check for restricted information. Retries may be made under normal rules.
Protected information still requires 1d4+1 hours for a check.
The purchase DC for using Gather Information is reduced by 10.
False Allegiance
The Arcane Arranger fits in with whatever group he chooses to be with. At 2nd level, the Arcane Arranger can successfully emulate an allegiance he knows about. He gains the +2 circumstance bonus on Charisma-based skills when dealing with an individual of the same allegiance. The allegiance and its bonus is considered in effect until a check is failed, at which point the false allegiance is revealed. Supernatural and spell-like abilities that determine allegiance are not affected by the Arcane Arranger’s false allegiance ability.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Arcane Arranger gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Arcane Arranger must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
Arcane Skills, Armor Proficiency (light), Attentive, Builder, Combat Expertise, Educated, Gearhead, Improved Disarm, Jack of All Trades, Renown, Studious, Trustworthy, Windfall.
Shadow Resources
At 4th level, the Arcane Arranger is well-enough wired into the social system to be able to get the names and numbers of individuals with particular abilities and talents. Even if away from his home stomping ground a phone call can produce a contact with the needed resource. Make a level check, adding all Arcane Arranger levels and any levels of Charismatic Hero. The difficulty of this task is based on how common the required abilities are:

|Common Skill (Ride, Pilot, Treat Injury) |DC 10|
|-----------------------------------------|----:|
|Uncommon Skill (subgroups of other skills such as Knowledge (arcane lore) or Craft (structural)) |DC 15|
|Rare Skill (skills available for a particular class—Spellcraft, Psicraft, Use Magic Device) |DC 20|
|Specific Feat |DC 20|
|Class Feature (spellcasting, turn undead, psionics) |DC 20|
|Specific Combination of Skills, Feats, and Abilities (someone with Knowledge (business) and the ability to cast the auguryspell) |DC 25|
|Finding someone willing to perform activities secretly or illegally |DC +5|
|Finding someone with a specific level of ability |Add desired ranks to DC|

A successful check indicates that the individual is available, and the Arcane Arranger knows about him. It does not guarantee the character contacted will be willing to perform the requested service—the party requesting the service must still negotiate for that person’s services. An unsuccessful check means that no such individual is immediately known or available to the Arcane Arranger. This does not negate trying again for a different skill, nor from trying to locate a skill resource through more traditional methods. The resource the Arcane Arranger knows about will have total ranks in the needed skill of at least the Arcane Arranger’s total character level +3.
Pack Rat
At 5th level, the Arcane Arranger is considered to have considerable material resources either at hand or easily and cheaply acquired. When making a Wealth check to determine if a particular item is “at hand,” add the Arcane Arranger class levels as a circumstance bonus.
Expert in Your Field
At 7th level, the Arcane Arranger is considered a master of connections, such that his reputation precedes him in his dealings with others. The Arcane Arranger gains a circumstance bonus equal to his Reputation bonus when making skill checks that are directly involved with Gather Information and Diplomacy skills. In addition, the Arcane Arranger may add his Reputation bonus on Wealth checks for new purchases.
Up My Sleeve
At 8th level, the Arcane Arranger gains the supernatural ability to pull a specific item out of thin air. As a move action, the Arcane Arranger may cause any item currently in his possession (with a size no greater than Small) to disappear into an extra-dimensional space. The item becomes impossible to detect by any means, however detect magical aura spells will reveal a moderate magical aura around the hand that last held the item. As a move action, the Arcane Arranger can cause the item to reappear in his hand. The Arcane Arranger may only hide one item at a time in this fashion.
At 10th level, the Arcane Arranger may use this ability to hide a single object of up to Large size or up to three objects of up to Small size (each of which may be retrieved individually).

Such skills would include applicable Knowledge skills, as well as such social skills as Intimidate and Bluff.
Weapon Stun

A weapon that would threaten a critical on 20 would now do so on a 19 or 20, and one which threatens on a 19 or 20 would now do so on an 18 to 20. This ability works with other abilities that increase threat ranges.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Mystic advanced class.
Arcane Skills
At 1st level, the Mystic gains the Arcane Skills feat, granting access to the following skills: Spellcraft, Use Magic Device, and the arcane functions of Concentration and Craft (chemical).
Divine Spells
The Mystic casts divine spells the same as Acolytes. A Mystic’s selection of spells is extremely limited. The Mystic begins play knowing four 0-level spells (called orisons) and two 1st-level spells. At each level, the mystic gains one or more new spells as indicated below). These spells can be common spells chosen from the Mystic’s spell list or they can be unusual spells of the Mystic’s own devising.
The Mystic is limited to casting a certain number of spells of each level per day, but need not prepare those spells in advance. The number of spells that may be cast per day may be increased by sufficiently high Charisma scores.
A Mystic may use a higher-level slot to cast a lower-level spell. The Mystic may spend an action point to “trade out” a known spell (losing it entirely) in exchange for another; in this fashion the Mystic is not penalized for filling all the slots of their known spells list.
Mystics do not have “cure” or “inflict” spells in their spell lists. Mystic may use incantations to cast these spells. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against the Mystic’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the Mystic’s Wisdom modifier. The Mystic doesn’t acquire her spells from books or scrolls, nor does she prepare them through study. Instead, she meditates or prays for her spells, receiving them through her own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. The Mystic must spend one hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain her daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on the Mystic’s spell preparation. In addition, the Mystic receives bonus spells based on her Wisdom score, as shown on the chart below.
Spell List: Mystics use the same spell list as Acolytes except that Mystics may not use the spells listed below.
0-level: Cure minor wounds, inflict minor wounds
1st-level: Cure light wounds, inflict light wounds
2nd-level: Cure moderate wounds, inflict moderate wounds
3rd-level: Cure serious wounds, inflict serious wounds
4th-level: Cure critical wounds, inflict critical wounds
5th-level: Mass cure light wounds, mass inflict light wounds, raise dead

Turn or Rebuke Undead
Starting at 2nd level, the Mystic gains the supernatural ability to affect the undead, such as zombies, skeletons, ghosts, and vampires in a manner similar to Acolyte. However, the Mystic’s allegiance does not effect the type of effects she has on the undead. Furthermore, the Mystic affects undead as if she were an Acolyte of one level lower than her current Mystic class.
A Mystic may turn, rebuke, command or bolster the undead. She may destroy the undead if of sufficient levels. She cannot dispel the turning of an Acolyte.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Mystic gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Mystic must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Alertness, Archaic Weapons Proficiency, Armor Proficiency (light), Attentive, Creative, Dodge, Educated, Empower Turning, Greater Spell Focus, Greater Spell Penetration, Improved Turning, Renown, Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Trustworthy, Windfall. The Mystic may also take any metamagic feats as bonus feats.
Combat Casting
At 4th level, the Mystic becomes adept at casting spells during combat. She gets a +4 bonus to Concentration checks made to cast a spell while on the defensive.
Brew Potion
At 5th level, the Mystic can create potions, which carry spells within themselves.
The Mystic can create a potion of any spell of 3rd level or lower that she knows. The spell must target a character or characters. Brewing a potion takes one day. When the Mystic creates a potion, she sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the Mystic’s own level.
The purchase DC of the raw material to brew a potion is 15 + the potion’s spell level + the potion’s caster level.
The Mystic must also spend experience points to brew a potion. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.
Finally, the Mystic makes a Craft (chemical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Mystic can try again the next day.
When the Mystic creates a potion, she makes any choices that she would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an experience point cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Mystic must expend the material component or pay the XP cost when creating the potion.
Discern Lie
The Mystic develops the ability to gauge whether another character is telling the truth by reading facial expressions and interpreting body language. The Mystic must be able to see and hear (but not necessarily understand) the individual under scrutiny.
The Mystic can determine whether a spoken statement is true or false with a successful Sense Motive check opposed by the subject’s Bluff check or DC 10, whichever is greater.
Turn or Rebuke Humans
Starting at 8th level, the Mystic gains the supernatural ability to affect humans, allowing her to command them or drive them off in the fashion of the Acolyte’s turn undead ability. The Mystic’s allegiance does not effect the type of effects she has on humans. The ability does not affect humanoids or other creatures. Unlike other turning abilities, the Mystic must spend an action point to turn or rebuke humans.
A Mystic may turn, rebuke, command or bolster humans. She cannot destroy the targeted humans with this ability, nor can she dispel the turning of another individual.
Empower Spell
At 10th level, the Mystic learns to cast spells to greater effect. All variable, numeric effects of an empowered spell are increased by one-half. An empowered spell deals half again as much damage as normal, cures half again as many hit points, affects half again as many targets, as appropriate. Spells without random variables are not affected. An empowered spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Therefore, a Mystic can only empower 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spells.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Shadow Hunter advanced class.
Target Bonus
The Shadow Hunter, as a full-round action, may designate an individual as a target. He spends one action point to select a target, and thereafter gains a competence bonus on certain actions involving that particular target. The Shadow Hunter does not need to know the target personally and may know her only through her actions or description. The Shadow Hunter may not select a target while he or the target is in combat, and once he chooses a target he must wait 24 hours before choosing another.
The Shadow Hunter gains the target bonus as a competence bonus on attacks against that particular target, as well as when using the following skills directly against the target, or in tracking a target: Bluff, Computer Use, Gather Information, Investigate, Listen, Research, Search, Sense Motive, and Spot. The target bonus applies to a single individual and lasts until the Shadow Hunter chooses a new target. The bonus is +1 at 1st level, +2 at 4th, and +3 at 7th level.
Swift Track

No Trace
At 4th level, the Shadow Hunter knows how to hide his own tracks, and may, at his choice, move into “No Trace” mode. All attempts to use the Track feat against the Shadow Hunter (though not allies) treat the ground as “firm” for purposes of success. In addition, the DC of any attempts to use Computer Use, Gather Information, Investigate, and Research on matters involving the Shadow Hunter are increased by the Shadow Hunter’s levels in this advanced class.
Play a Hunch
At 5th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the supernatural ability to make a guess and be assured that it is correct. The Shadow Hunter may, as a full-round action, spend an action point to determine whether an assumption, hunch, or guess is correct. The player states the assertion and pays an action point. Secretly rolls percentile dice; there is a 70% +1% per character level chance of getting a response on the hunch (failure indicates merely that you are unsure if this is true or not).
If the roll is a success, the player knows if the hunch is true, false, both or neither. A “both” response is possible for vague assumptions. An “unknown” response is for questions with no immediate answer.
It may be determined that a hunch is so obvious that it does not require a roll, or that it is so vague that there is no chance for success. In these cases, the action point is not spent (though the attempt still counts as a full-round action). A hunch does not translate as a legal truth, and will not stand up in a court of law. Rather it is an obvious fact to the Shadow Hunter alone. Finding proof of an assumption would require additional work.
Detect Magical Aura
At 8th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the spell-like ability to detect magical aura. The Shadow Hunter may use this effect up to three times per day, and each use lasts for 20 minutes.
Locate Target
At 10th level, the Shadow Hunter gains the supernatural ability to know where his target is, if in the target is in the general vicinity (1,000 feet of the Shadow Hunter). This ability applies only to the target, and does not reveal attitude, status, or the presence of others around the target. This is a supernatural ability, and spells, psionics, and other FX that interfere with supernatural abilities will foil the locate target ability as well.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Shadowjack advanced class.
Read/Write Code
Beginning at 1st level, the Shadowjack can understand both the nature of raw computer code and what the program is intended to accomplish when implemented. On a successful Decipher Script check (DC 10 + Computer Use skill modifier of the code’s author), the Shadowjack can determine both the function of the program and any bugs or potential weak points in the design. If weak points are found, the Shadowjack gains a +2 insight bonus on Computer Use checks attempting to degrade the program.
Online Presence
Beginning at 2nd level, when attempting to use a Charism-abased skill such a Bluff, Intimidate, Diplomacy, or Gather
Information in an online situation, the Shadowjack adds any Shadowjack levels as a circumstance bonus.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Shadowjack gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Shadowjack must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it. Alertness, Arcane Skills, Builder, Cautious, Educated, Gearhead, Lightning Reflexes, Low Profile, Meticulous, Renown, Studious, Windfall.
Shadowjack Abilities
Beginning at 4th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
Electronic Empathy: The Shadowjack gains a +2 competence bonus when repairing or disabling electronic devices. This is in addition to any synergy bonuses for related skills.
Careful Progress: When the Shadowjack attempts to defeat computer security, the administrator is alerted only if the Shadowjack fails his Computer Use check by 10 or more. At 5th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
False Trail: When covering his electronically tracks through the internet, the Shadowjack can lay in a false trail. With a successful DC 25 Computer Use check, the Shadowjack imposes a –5 penalty on any attempt to trace him (as described in the Defend Security function of the Computer Use skill). If the trace fails by 10 or more points, the tracker follows the Shadowjack’s false trail to an innocent internet address. If the trace fails by less than 10 points, the tracker realizes the trail is bogus and gives up.
Install Backdoor: After successfully breaking into a specific computer system, the Shadowjack can install a “backdoor” to the system. A backdoor is a piece of code that makes it easier for the Shadowjack to break into that particular system in the future. Writing and installing the program requires a Computer Use check (see chart below), but once successfully installed it automatically defeats that systems’ security upon return trips—the Shadowjack no longer needs to make Computer Use checks to enter that system.

|Level of Security|DC|
|----------------|:-:|
|Minimum|25|
|Average|30|
|Exceptional|40|
|Maximum|45|

It is important to keep backdoors hidden from the system administrator, who will always be on the lookout for such invasions. A backdoor automatically allows the Shadowjack entrance to a particular system, but every time he uses it he must make an opposed Computer Use check against the administrator. Failure means the backdoor is discovered and will be deleted before the next time the Shadowjack returns.
At 7th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
Online Spell Resistance: The Shadowjack becomes harder to hurt by spells and spell-like abilities sent through email and electronic devices, including the Techno Mage’s online spellcasting ability as well as magical items which use electronic components. The Shadowjack gains Spell Resistance equal to 10 + his Shadowjack levels. This is a supernatural ability.
Improved Degradation: The Shadowjack’s attempts to alter and degrade existing programming get more insidious. The degradation is installed as normal (as described in the
Degrade Programming function of the Computer Use skill). However, unless the Computer Use check to fix the degraded program exceeds the DC by 5, the degradation returns within 6 hours—this happens automatically, the Shadowjack does not have to make a second check.
At 8th level, the Shadowjack gains the following abilities:
Passfirewall: When the Shadowjack attempts to defeat computer security, the administrator is alerted only if the Shadowjack rolls a 1 on his Computer Use check.
Walking Database: The Shadowjack gains the supernatural ability to recall vast amounts of information gleaned while traveling through cyberspace. He may spend an action point and then substitute his Computer Use score instead of a Knowledge score for the purposes of one check.
Virtual Incantations
At 10th level, the Shadowjack gains the spell-like ability to use a computer to cast incantations. This process reduces the number of secondary casters required by 10, and may allow the Shadowjack to shorten the casting time. If he is successful at a Computer Use check with a DC equal to the DC for the incantation’s skill check, the casting time is reduced to 1/10th of its original length. All other requirements for the incantation (components, saving throws, backlash, and so forth) remain the same.

Uncanny Dodge X
The Speed Demon gains the ability of Uncanny Dodge, or increases the potency of this ability if she already has it. If the Speed Demon does not have Uncanny Dodge 1 (usually gained as a Fast hero), she gains Uncanny Dodge 1: She retains her Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden attacker. (She still loses her Dexterity bonus to Defense if she’s immobilized.) If the Speed Demon already has Uncanny Dodge 1, she gains Uncanny Dodge 2: She can no longer be flanked; she can react to opponents on opposite sides of herself as easily as she can react to a single attacker.
If the Speed Demon already has Uncanny Dodge 2, then she gains no further benefit from this ability.

Vehicle Empathy

The Speed Demon must be in contact with the vehicle, and loses control of it if she no longer maintains contact. The vehicle must be a vehicle with which the Speed Demon has the Vehicle Specialization feat.
The Speed Demon must make a Drive check for commandeering a vehicle. The DC is 10 for an otherwise uncontrolled vehicle or one in which the controller allows the Speed Demon to assume control. If the controller of the vehicle resists the Speed Demon’s attempts, the DC is 10 + the controller’s Drive skill.
Leadfoot
At 7th level, the Speed Demon gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks when controlling a vehicle.
Redlining the Needle
At 8th level, the Speed Demon treats Check/Roll Modifiers for All-Out and Highway Speeds as Street Speeds (reduced to –1 as opposed to –2 and –4, respectively).
Restore Vehicle
At 9th level, the Speed Demon gains the supernatural ability to, as a move action or part of a move action, restore a vehicle to working condition. The Speed Demon spends an action point and restores up to 10 points of damage to a vehicle she is in contact with. The restoration is magical in nature, and may be performed while the vehicle is in motion. The Speed Demon may restore damaged portions of the vehicle, such as tires, in the same manner.
One with the Vehicle
At 10th level, the Speed Demon develops supernatural reflexes behind the wheel, effectively reacting as if vehicle and body were one. When the Speed Demon is in control of a vehicle, she can add her Defense bonus to that of the vehicle. The Defense bonus applies to all parts of the vehicle, including windshields, tires, and passengers.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Techno Mage advanced class.
Arcane Spells and Armor
The Techno Mage can become proficient in the use of armor, and while his limitations are not as great as the traditional Mage, he still has a difficult time casting most arcane spells while wearing it. Armor restricts movement, making the complicated gestures needed to cast spells with somatic components harder to perform. When casting an arcane spell with a somatic component, the chance of arcane spell failure depends on the type of armor being worn, as shown below.

|Armor Type|Arcane Spell Failure, Proficient|Arcane Spell Failure, Nonproficient|
|----------|:------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|Light|0%|10%|
|Medium|10%|20%|
|Heavy|20%|30%|

Spellfiles
The Techno Mage must study her spellfiles each day to prepare her spells. The Techno Mage can’t prepare any spell not recorded in her spellfiles (except for read magic, which the Techno Mage can prepare from memory). The Techno Mage begins play with spellfiles containing all 0-level arcane spells and three 1st-level arcane spells of the player’s choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the Techno Mage has, her spellfiles hold one additional 1st-level arcane spell. Each time the character attains a new level of Techno Mage, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that she can cast, according to her new level. The Techno Mage can also add spells found in other Techno Mages’ spellfiles or Mage’s spellbooks. (Mages may use spells found in the files of Techno Mages.)
A set of spellfiles is usually put into a notebook or desktop computer, or a PDA. Occasionally they are put on a secure website to allow access by cell phone or satellite phone. Backup files are a must, and are usually kept in another location (such as a safety deposit box). Hard copy is also used for storage of spellfiles, sometimes bound in spellbooks.
Arcane Skills
At 1st level, the Techno Mage gains access to the arcane skill Spellcraft and the expansion of the Concentration skill, as described under the Mage entry.
Arcane Spells
The Techno Mage’s key talent is the ability to cast arcane spells.
The Techno Mage is limited to a certain number of spells of each spell level per day, according to his Techno Mage class level. The Techno Mage must prepare spells ahead of time by resting for eight hours and spending one hour studying his spellfiles. While studying, the Techno Mage decides which spells to prepare. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the Techno Mage must have an Intelligence score of at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for saving throws against the Techno Mage’s spells is 10 + the spell’s level + the Techno Mage’s Intelligence modifier.
In addition, the Techno Mage receives bonus spells based on his Intelligence score, as shown below.
|Int Score\\Bonus Spells by Spell Level|1|2|3|4|5|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|12–13|1|—|—|—|—|

Machine Empathy
At 2nd Level, the Techno Mage is so comfortable with technology that she gains a +2 competence bonus with any electronic or mechanical device, and in addition may use any skill that involves technology untrained.
Program Spell
At 3rd level, the Techno Mage may spend an action point to insert a spell within a particular analog or digital device, such that by touching a key (or flicking a switch), the spell activates. All variables of the spell are set at the time of casting.
Casting a spell takes the normal amount of time; discharging a programmed spell is an attack action.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Techno Mage gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Techno Mage must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
Armor Proficiency (light), Builder, Educated, Gearhead, Greater Spell Focus, Greater Spell Penetration, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Spell Focus, Spell Penetration, Studious, Windfall.
The Techno Mage may also take any metamagic feats as bonus feats.
Create Homunculus
At 4th level, the Techno Mage can create a homunculus. The homunculus may be flesh, digital, chemical, or biochemical in nature.
Creating a homunculus requires a DC 25 Wealth check to acquire the appropriate equipment. The materials used are consumed in the creation of the homunculus. In addition, the creation of a homunculus requires a pint of the Techno Mage’s blood.
It takes a week to create a homunculus. During this time the Techno Mage must labor for 8 hours a day. A character not actively working on the ritual must perform no other activities except eating, sleeping, or talking. If she misses a day, the process fails, and the ritual must begin anew. At the end of the period, the Techno Mage makes an appropriate skill check for the Craft skill connected with the particular subtype of homunculus (DC 20). A failure indicates loss of the subject (requiring the Techno Mage to begin again) but no other penalty.
The Techno Mage may create any number of homunculi. However, when a homunculi perishes, its death deals 2d10 points of damage to the Techno Mage, so caution is usually the by-word in homunculus creation.
Arcane Spontaneous Casting
At 5th, the Techno Mage chooses a number of spells she already knows equal to her Intelligence modifier. From that point on, the Techno Mage can cast those spells in place of already-chosen spells of the same level. The Techno Mage “loses” a prepared spell to cast another spell of the same level or lower.
Spell Focus
At 7th level, the Techno Mage gains Spell Focus as a bonus feat.
Online Casting
At 8th level, the Techno Mage can cast spells through electronic devices, including cameras, cell phones, and modems.
If the spell requires the caster to be seen, then the target must see the caster, if it requires the caster to be heard, then
the target must be able to hear the caster. Range is determined from the caster to the pick-up device (camera, keyboard, etc.) and then from the device to its target. The space between keyboard and monitor, or camera and screen, is not considered. The Techno Mage must be able to see or otherwise be able to determine the location of her target (“person at the keyboard” is a suitable target). Spells cast online are less effective, such that the target gets a +4 circumstance bonus on saving throws.
Quicken Spell
At 10th level, the Techno Mage learns to cast some spells as free actions. With but a moment’s thought (and the proper verbal, somatic, and material components). She can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as she casts a quickened spell. She may only cast one quickened spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
A quickened spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Quicken spell is considered a metamagic ability for purposes of interacting with metamagic feats.
When a quickened spell is prepared, it is treated as a spell of four levels higher than the spell’s actual level, such that only 0- and 1st level spells may be quickened by a Techno Mage.

THRASHER
The fastest path into this advanced class is from the Tough hero basic class, though other paths are possible.
Requirements
To qualify to become an Thrasher, a character must fulfill the following criteria.

Skills: Concentration 6 ranks, Survival 6 ranks.
Feats: Athletic or Endurance.

|9th|+6|+6|+4|+3|Bonus feat|+5|+2|
|10th|+7|+7|+5|+3|Damage reduction 10/+1|+5|+2|

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Thrasher advanced class.
Tough Defense
Using his constitution instead of his dexterity, the Thrasher applies his Constitution bonus to his Defense instead of his Dexterity bonus. Any situation that would deny the Thrasher his Dexterity bonus to Defense denies the Constitution bonus.
Ability Surge
At 2nd, 5th, and 8th level, the Thrasher can temporarily increase his Strength and Dexterity, but at a penalty to saving throws. The Thrasher gains a +4 morale bonus to both Strength and Dexterity, but takes a –2 penalty on all saving throws. Activating ability surge is a free action, and the surge lasts for as many rounds as the character has Thrasher levels. Following an ability surge, the Thrasher is fatigued (–2 to Strength and Dexterity) for as many rounds as he surged, but may negate this penalty as a free action by spending an action point.
The Thrasher may use the ability surge once per day at 2nd level, twice per day at 5th level, and three times per day at 8th level.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Thrasher gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Thrasher must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
Alertness, Blind-Fight, Brawl, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Far Shot, Focused, Great Cleave, Improved Brawl, Improved Knockout Punch, Improved Trip, Knockout Punch, Power Attack.
Uncanny Dodge X
The Thrasher gains the ability of Uncanny Dodge, or increases the potency of this ability if he already has it.
If the Thrasher does not have Uncanny Dodge 1 (usually gained as a Fast hero), he gains Uncanny Dodge 1: He retains his Dexterity bonus to Defense (if any) regardless of being caught flat-footed or struck by a hidden attacker. (He still loses his Dexterity bonus to Defense if he’s immobilized.)
If the Thrasher already has Uncanny Dodge 1, he gains Uncanny Dodge 2: He can no longer be flanked; he can react to opponents on opposite sides of himself as easily as he can react to a single attacker.
If the Thrasher already has Uncanny Dodge 2, then he gains no further benefit from this ability.
Damage Reduction
Starting at 7th level, the Thrasher gains the ability to use the ambient magic around him to shrug off some amount of injury from each attack. The Thrasher gains damage reduction 5/+1. Subtract 5 from the damage the Thrasher takes each time he is dealt damage from a physical attack—usually weapons or natural attacks but not energy attacks (magical or nonmagical in origin, spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities). Ignore damage reduction if the damage is from a magic
weapon or attack of +1 bonus or higher. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0, but not below 0. Damage reduction does not stack with itself unless otherwise stated—if the Thrasher gains other forms of damage reduction, apply the best damage reduction for the situation. Damage reduction from the Thrasher class may stack with the Tough hero damage reduction tree; in this case add the benefit of those damage reductions for attacks from melee and ranged weapons.
At 10th level, this damage reduction increases to 10/+1.

WILDLORD
The fastest path into this advanced class is from a combination of Strong and Tough hero basic classes, though other paths are possible.
Requirements
To qualify to become a Wildlord, a character must fulfill the following criteria.
Base Attack Bonus: +2.
Skills: Handle Animal 6 ranks, Survival 6 ranks.
Class Information
The following information pertains to the Wildlord advanced class.
Hit Die
Wildlords gain 1d8 hit points per level. The character’s Constitution modifier applies.
Action Points
Wildlords gain a number of action points equal to 6 plus one-half their character level, rounded down, every time they advance a level in this class.
Class Skills
The Wildlord’s class skills are as follows: Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Drive (Dex), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (Behavioral sciences, earth and life sciences, physical sciences), Move Silently (Dex), Navigate (Int), Pilot (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), Treat Injury (Wis).

|10th|+7|+7|+3|+7|Command/rebuke magical beasts|+5|+4|

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Wildlord advanced class.
Animal Empathy
At 1st level, the Wildlord gains the ability to use her Handle Animal skill to improve the attitude of an animal or magical beast. The interaction is treated as a Diplomacy skill check, with Handle Animal used instead of Diplomacy. The Wildlord needs to be within 30 feet of the creature to use this ability.
Most domestic animals have a starting attitude of indifferent, while most wild animals are unfriendly. (Exceptions exist: trained guard dogs may have an initial reaction of hostile to strangers.)
The Wildlord may also seek to influence magical beasts (including those she has never encountered before) at a –4 penalty. Animal empathy does not function on vermin.
Track
At 2nd level, the Wildlord gains Track as a bonus feat, if she does not already have it.
Animal Companion
At 2nd level, the Wildlord may spend an action point to transform an encountered animal into an animal companion. This requires a full-round action. The animal must already be friendly in attitude toward the Wildlord. This animal accompanies the Wildlord on her adventures as is appropriate to its species. The Wildlord may have a single animal companion at a time.
Choose an animal from the following list: Ape, bear, big cat, boar, crocodile, deinonychus, dog (medium), donkey, eagle, elephant, herd animal (such as cow, camel, or bison), horse, lizard, monkey, octopus, porpoise, snake (constrictor, viper), squid, tiger, or wolf. The creature may be an animal of Shadow. The animal cannot have more Hit Dice than the Wildlord has character levels.
The animal chosen remains an animal, but may gain additional abilities according to the level of the Wildlord (see Animal Companions, below). The player running a Wildlord should consider the fact that certain animals may create problems in urban areas.
The Wildlord may release the animal back to the wild, regaining the action point initially spent in the process. The Wildlord does not regain the action point if the creatures dies. In either case, the Wildlord must wait at least 24 hours before attempting to gain another animal companion.
Bonus Feats
At 3rd, 6th, and 9th level, the Wildlord gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Wildlord must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
Animal Affinity, Athletic, Dodge, Endurance, Focused, Personal Firearms Proficiency, Renown, Stealthy.
Fast Climb
At 3rd level, the Wildlord becomes an expert at climbing. A successful Climb check allows her to move her full speed rather than at half speed when climbing.
Resist Venom
At 4th level, the Wildlord gains +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against natural poisons.
Call Companion
At 4th level, the Wildlord gains the supernatural ability to call her animal companion to her. The animal companion must be in the area (within a mile of the Wildlord’s location), and will arrive within 10d6 minutes. Situations which the Wildlord and animal companion are clearly separated the animal will express consternation and distress but will not be able to respond.
Skill Mastery
At 5th level, the Wildlord designates one skill from her Wildlord class skill list. When making a check with this skill, the Wildlord may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. She becomes so certain in the use of this skill that she can use it reliably even under adverse conditions.
Expert in Your Field
At 7th level, the Wildlord is considered to be a master of nature lore, animals, and plants. The Wildlord gains a circumstance bonus equal to her Reputation bonus when making skill checks that are directly involved with her knowledge of the natural world. Such skills would include applicable Knowledge skills, as well as such social skills as Intimidate and Bluff when animals are involved.
Command/Rebuke Animals
At 8th level, the Wildlord may spend an action point to turn, command, or rebuke animals. This functions in the same manner as the ability to turn undead for the Acolyte.
Transform Companion
At 9th level, the Wildlord gains the supernatural ability to transform her animal companion into a small, inert object, such as a charm, a totem, or a stuffed animal, that may be carried around. While in object form, the transformed companion has the properties of the item.
The Wildlord may, as a move action or part of a move action, cast the object to the ground and cause it to immediately take its original form. The transformed creature is considered a magical beast as long as it remains the Wildlord’s companion.
Command/Rebuke Magical Beasts
At 10th level, the Wildlord may spend an action point to turn, command, or rebuke magical beasts. This functions in the same manner as the ability to turn, command, or rebuke undead for the Acolyte.

Animal Companions
As the Wildlord grows in power and ability, so too does the power of her animal companion.

Class Level: The level of the Wildlord.
Bonus HD: These are extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion’s base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion’s base attack bonus is equal to a Wildlord whose level equals the animal’s HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal’s HD). The animal companion doesn’t gain any extra skill points or feats for bonus HD.
Natural Armor: The number listed here is an improvement to the animal companion’s natural armor rating.
Str/Dex Adj.: Add this figure to the animal companion’s Strength and Dexterity scores.
Link (Ex): The Wildlord gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Animal Empathy and Handle Animal checks made regarding the animal companion.
Evasion (Ex): If the animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.
Devotion (Ex): The animal companion’s devotion to its master is so complete, it gains a +4 morale bonus on all Will saves against Enchantment spells and effects.
Multiattack (Ex): The animal companion gains the Multiattack feat, if it has 3 or more natural attacks. If it does not have the requisite 3 or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural attack, albeit at a –5 to the base attack bonus.
Improved Evasion (Ex): If the animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Artificer prestige class.
Craft Artifice
At each level of Artificer, choose one of the following item creation talents. The Artificer must have ranks in the appropriate Craft skill to use the talent. Note that for talents that are available to other arcane advanced classes, the Artificer’s version is less expensive.
Craft Wand: With this talent, the Artificer can create wands, which carry spells within themselves. The Artificer can create a wand of any spell of 4th level or lower that he knows. Crafting a wand takes 12 hours x the spell’s level. When the Artificer creates a wand, he sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the Artificer’s total class levels in all arcane spellcasting classes (Artificer, Mage, Techno Mage). The caster level has an effect on the purchase DC of the raw materials to craft the wand, the skill check to create the wand, the experience point cost to craft the wand, and the DC of a saving throw (if applicable) to resist the effect of the wand.
The purchase DC for the raw material that the Artificer requires to craft a wand is 18 + the level of the spell stored in the wand + the wand’s caster level.
The Artificer must also spend experience points to craft a wand. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level the purchase DC of the raw materials.
Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (mechanical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the spell stored in the wand. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try crafting the wand again as soon as he purchases more raw materials.
When an Artificer creates a wand, he makes any choices that he would normally make when casting the spell. A newly crafted wand has 50 charges.
Any wand that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend 50 copies of the material component or pay 50 times the XP cost when creating the wand.
Improved Brew Potion: With this talent, the Artificer can create potions, which carry spells within themselves. The Artificer can create a potion of any spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows. The spell must target a character or characters. Brewing a potion takes 24 hours. When the Artificer creates a potion, he sets the caster level. The caster level must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than the Artificer’s total class levels in all arcane spellcasting classes (Artificer, Mage, Techno Mage). The caster level has an effect on the purchase DC of the raw materials to brew the potion, the skill check to create the potion, the experience point cost to brew the potion, and the DC of a saving throw (if applicable) to resist the effect of the potion. The purchase DC for the raw material that the Artificer requires to brew a potion is 12 + the potion’s spell level + the potion’s caster level. The Artificer must also spend experience points to brew a potion. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials. Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (chemical) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the potion. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try brewing the potion again as soon as he purchases more raw materials. When an Artificer creates a potion, he makes any choices that he would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell. Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend the material component or pay the XP when creating the potion.
Improved Scribe Scroll: With this talent, the Artificer can create scrolls from which he or another spellcaster can cast a scribed spell. You can create a scroll of any spell you know. Scribing a scroll takes one day. The purchase DC for the raw materials to scribe a scroll is 10 + the scroll’s spell level + the scroll’s caster level.
The Artificer must also spend experience points to scribe a scroll. The XP cost is equal to the spell level x the caster level x the purchase DC of the raw materials.
Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (writing) skill check. The DC for the check is 10 + the spell level + the caster level of the scroll. If the check fails, the raw materials are used up but the XP are not spent. The Artificer can try scribing the scroll again as soon as he purchases more raw materials.
Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the raw materials cost, the Artificer must expend the material component or pay the XP when scribing the scroll.
A scroll can be written on a sheet of paper or parchment, or it can be saved as a file on a computer or PDA.
Improved Scribe Tattoo: With this talent, an Artificer can create tattoos on his body or on someone else’s. Tattoos function similarly to scrolls, and are created in the same way (see Scribe Scroll), except that the pertinent skill is Craft (visual arts). Magic Mastercraft: With this talent, the Artificer can create magical mastercraft items.
Each time the Artificer selects this Craft Artifice talent, he applies it to either armor or weapons. From this point on, he can build magical mastercraft items of that type. The Artificer uses his Craft (mechanical) and Craft (chemical) to build weapons and armor and embue them with magical enhancements. On average, it takes twice as long to build a magic mastercraft item as it does an ordinary item of the same type. The cost to build a magic mastercraft item is equal to the purchase DC for the components (see the appropriate Craft skill description) + an additional amount based on the magical enhancement bonus: +1 bonus, +5 to the purchase DC; +2 bonus, +10 to the purchase DC; +3 bonus, +15 to the purchase DC. You can add the magic mastercraft feature to an existing ordinary item by making the Wealth check and then making the Craft check as though you were constructing the item from scratch. The Artificer must also spend experience points to create a magic mastercraft item. The XP cost is equal to the enhancement bonus x 10 x the purchase DC of the components. The XP must be paid before making the Craft checks. If the expenditure of these XP would drop the Artificer to below the minimum needed for his current level, then the XP can’t be paid and the mastercraft work can’t be done until the Artificer gains enough additional XP to remain at his current level after the expenditure is made. Finally, the Artificer makes a Craft (mechanical) skill check and a Craft (chemical) skill check to complete the work. The DC for the Craft (mechanical) check is 20 + the enhancement bonus for armor; 25 + the enhancement bonus for weapons. The DC for the Craft (chemical) check is 25 + the enhancement bonus – the Artificer’s class level.
Bonus Feat
At 2nd and 4th level, the Artificer gets a bonus feat. The bonus feat must be selected from the following list, and the Artificer must meet all of the prerequisites for the feat to select it.
Empower Spell, Enlarge Spell, Eschew Materials, Extend Spell, Heighten Spell, Nonlethal Spell, Reach Spell, Sacred Spell, Shadowbane Spell.

One Ecclesiarch may choose to affect fey, while another may affect constructs, and a third may choose to affect dragons. The new creature type replaces that of the previous one, and all limitations to the previous power apply (if the character could not bolster the previous creature type, he cannot bolster the new creature type). Certain types of creatures have restrictions on how they may be affected. The types that may be affected are:

Class Features
The following features pertain to the Holy/Unholy Knight prestige class.
Divine Spells
The Holy/Unholy Knight casts divine spells. Unless noted below, the Holy/Unholy Knight’s ability functions identically to the Acolyte’s spellcasting abilities. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against the Holy/Unholy Knight’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the Holy/Unholy Knight’s Wisdom modifier.
The Holy/Unholy Knight doesn’t acquire spells from books, scrolls, or files, nor does he prepare them through study. Instead, he meditates or prays for his spells, receiving them through his own strength of faith or as divine inspiration. The Holy/Unholy Knight must spend one hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on the Holy/Unholy Knight’s spell preparation.
The Holy/Unholy Knight receives no benefit to number of spells due to higher ability scores.

Divine Grace
At 1st level, a Holy/Unholy Knight applies his Charisma modifier (if positive) as a bonus on all saving throws.
Sense Allegiance
At 2nd level, The Holy/Unholy Knight cans sense the presence of characters, creatures, and items of both his chosen allegiance, and his opposing allegiance (the Holy Knight has “good” as a chosen allegiance, and “evil” as an opposing allegiance, while the Unholy Knight has the reverse). The sense allegiance ability extends in a 60-foot radius around the Knight, but may be concentrated to a quarter circle emanating forward from the Knight. You can pinpoint allegiance more finely with a successful Search check (DC 25).
Smite Allegiance
At 3rd level, the Holy/Unholy Knight gains the ability to smite characters, creatures, or items of opposing allegiance with a single melee attack (the Holy Knight has “evil” as an opposing allegiance, the Unholy Knight has “good” as an opposing allegiance).
The Holy/Unholy Knight spends an action point and, in addition to the normal benefit of the action point, gains a bonus to the attack equal to his Charisma modifier (if positive) and deals 1 extra point of damage per total character levels of the Holy/Unholy Knight.
Should the attack miss, the action point is expended. Similarly, the action point is expended if the Holy/Unholy Knight uses it and strikes a target that does not have an opposing allegiance. Smite allegiance is considered a supernatural ability.
Divine Touch
At 4th level, the Holy/Unholy Knight gains the ability to channel divine energy through his body and apply it directly to himself or another character. With this ability the Knight can restore lost hit points with a single touch; he may also choose to deal holy damage to a target with a simple a touch attack. Each day the Holy/Unholy Knight may cure or deal a number of points of damage equal to his Charisma bonus times his total character level. The Holy Knight is not limited to curing wounds, nor is the Unholy Knight restricted to inflicting them. It is possible to combine this ability with smite allegiance to increase the amount of damage dealt by a touch attack. Massive damage rules apply.
Use of this ability may be guided by the Holy/Unholy Knight’s allegiance, and widespread abuse may cause the Holy/Unholy Knight to lose his chosen allegiance.
Turn Undead
At 5th level, the Holy/Unholy Knight can turn undead in the same manner as the Acolyte. The Holy Knight affects undead in the same manner as an Acolyte with good allegiance (turning or destroying undead), while the Unholy Knight affects undead in the same manner as an Acolyte with evil allegiance (rebuking or commanding them). Count all Holy/Unholy Knight and Acolyte levels when determining level for purposes of turning.
Former Knights
A Holy/Unholy Knight who loses his chosen allegiance, intentionally or not, loses all Holy/Unholy Knight special abilities, including the ability to cast divine spells. He may no longer progress in levels of Holy/Unholy Knight, but can regain use of those abilities if he atones for his actions.
The Holy/Unholy Knight may switch sides entirely, taking its former opposed allegiance. In this case, none of the Knight’s abilities are lost, and the Knight merely changes his designation from Holy to Unholy (being a Fallen Knight) or Unholy to Holy (being a Redeemed Knight). Such a switch of allegiance is dramatic, such that the Fallen/Redeemed Knight automatically kicks off the sense allegiance ability for Knights of its now-opposed allegiance.
