SHADOWKIND
Most characters who are not native to the mundane world hail from a place beyond Shadow, and they are known to “mundanes” as Shadowkind.
You can also play characters native to Earth who are the offspring or descendants of Shadowkind.
Characters who enter our world through Shadow have no way of returning home and are forced to adapt to their new environment. Moreover, they retain only a few hazy memories of the place from whence they came.

PLAYING A SHADOWKIND
Shadowkind characters share several traits, as noted below.

Creature of Shadow
Creatures brought to our world by Shadow are reclaimed by the tides of Shadow after they die. As a general rule, a creature of Shadow vanishes 1d4 rounds after it dies (drops to –10 hit points), leaving behind no trace of itself other than its clothing and equipment. Shadowkind heroes have stronger ties to our world than other creatures of Shadow; they fade away 1d4 hours after they die. Before they disappear, slain Shadowkind characters can be raised from the dead as easily as mundane characters can. Slain creatures of Shadow that are transformed into undead creatures remain on our world in their undead state and are not reclaimed by Shadow until they are destroyed.
A slain Shadowkind character who is reclaimed by Shadow can’t be raised from the dead or brought back by any means and is considered lost.
A Shadowkind character is treated as a “creature of Shadow” with regard to special abilities, spells, and psionic powers that affect creatures of Shadow.

Skill Points Per Level
Shadowkind characters do not gain as many skill points as a human character of the same class. Shadowkind characters get 4 fewer skill points at 1st level and 1 fewer skill point each level thereafter.

Native Shadowkind vs. New Arrivals
Characters can be nonhuman natives of our world—the children of one or more Shadowkind parents, born and raised somewhere on Earth—or they can be new arrivals to our world, having recently come through Shadow. In the latter case, Shadowkind characters suffer the disadvantages of being “strangers in a strange land.” They are restricted to a handful of starting occupations at 1st level, they have no wealth to speak of, and they speak bizarre languages unknown to the majority of Earth’s population (though they also acquire the common language of the land they arrive in as a function of passing through Shadow).

Starting Occupation
A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind must select from the following starting occupations: hedge wizard, noviate, and squire. In addition, regardless of the Wealth bonus provided by the starting occupation, see Starting Wealth Bonus, below.
Only humans and Shadowkind characters born and raised in our mundane world can select from all starting occupations.

Starting Wealth Bonus


A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind has a starting Wealth bonus of +2 to +12 (roll 2d6). However, the character must spend this entire Wealth bonus on personal gear typical of a medieval fantasy character (such as archaic weapons and armor). Any portion of the character’s Wealth bonus that goes unspent is lost; in effect, the character begins play with some primitive personal items and equipment and a starting Wealth bonus of +0.
Shadowkind characters born and raised in our world follow the normal rules for determining Wealth bonus.

Languages Known
A character who begins play as a newly arrived Shadowkind knows one or more languages, most of which are not spoken on Earth. Such languages include Celestial, Draconic, Elven, and Goblin. However, they all share a common language (called Common) that has striking parallels to the predominant language spoken in the area where they arrived. Shadowkind characters born and raised in our world gain languages as human characters do. In addition to one or more local languages, they may know one or more languages of Shadow (taught to them by their parents and elders).

SHADOWKIND SPECIES
Each Shadowkind entry consists of a description of the species, including appearance and general disposition. It also provides insight into how the species generally interacts with the mundane world. Following the descriptive text is a summary of general traits and special qualities.
Size: The species’ size. Shadowkind that are exceptionally large or small receive modifiers to their Defense, attack rolls, grapple checks, and Hide skill checks.
Ability Modifiers: These modifiers adjust the ability scores of every member of the species.
Base Speed: The distance an average member of the species can move (in feet) during a move action. In general, Medium and Large characters have a base speed of 30 feet, while Small characters have a base speed of 20 feet. Dwarves, though Medium, are slower due to their stockiness.
Special Qualities: Special qualities include species bonuses to skill checks and saving throws, bonus feats, and natural armor bonuses to Defense (if any). This section also describes any special abilities of the species, including special combat bonuses, the ability so see in low light or utter darkness, and the ability to resist magic.
Free Language Skills: Shadowkind species receive a certain number of Read/Write Language and Speak Language skills for free, without spending any skill points. These free language skills are listed here.
Other Languages: Other Shadow languages commonly known to members of the species. Shadowkind may learn additional languages, following the rules presented under the Speak Language and Read/Write Language skill descriptions.
SMALL CHARACTERS
Small characters (such as gnomes, goblins, and halflings) gain a +1 size bonus to Defense, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on Hide checks. They suffer a –4 penalty on grapple checks.
Small characters’ lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of Medium characters.
Small characters generally move about two-thirds as fast as Medium characters (goblins are exceptions).
Small characters must use smaller weapons than Medium characters. They must use two hands to wield a weapon of Medium, and a weapon must be of Tiny size or smaller for them to consider it as a light weapon.
Armor for Small characters can be chopped down from extant protective outfits. It costs the same as Medium armor and weighs half as much. A Medium or larger creature cannot wear armor sized for a Small character.

DWARF
Size: Medium. Dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
Ability Modifiers: +2 Constitution, –2 Charisma.

Special Combat Bonuses: Dwarves gain a +1 species bonus on attack rolls against bugbears, goblins, orcs, and other goblinoids. Dwarves also gain a +4 dodge bonus to Defense against creatures of giants (including giants, trolls, and ogres). If a dwarf loses his positive Dexterity bonus to Defense (such as when flat-footed), this dodge bonus is lost.
Stability: Dwarves gain a +4 species bonus on ability checks to resist bull rush and trip attempts when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

Skill Bonuses: Dwarves gain a +2 species bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, new construction, unsafe surfaces, ceilings, and the like. A dwarf who merely passes within 10 feet of such exceptional construction can, as a free action, make a Search check (DC 15) as though he were actively searching for such.
Dwarves are naturally skilled mechanics and engineers. They gain a +2 species bonus on Craft (mechanical), Craft (structural), and Repair checks.

Note that any time a gnome loses his positive Dexterity bonus to Defense, such as when he’s caught flat-footed, he loses this dodge bonus, too.
Illusion Mastery: Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws against Illusion spells cast by gnomes.
Speak with Animals: Once per day, a gnome can use speak with animals to speak with a burrowing mammal (a mole, gopher, ground hog, and so forth). It has a duration of 1 minute, and the gnome is considered a 1st-level caster when he uses this spell-like ability, regardless of his actual level.

MORE POWERFUL SHADOWKIND

LEVEL ADJUSTMENT AND CHALLENGE RATING
Particularly powerful Shadowkind species have a Level Adjustment, which reflects how much more powerful these species are compared to “baseline” species (such as elves, dwarves, and humans). When you add this Level Adjustment to a character’s total class levels (or character level), the result is a character’s Challenge Rating (CR). The formula for determining a character’s Challenge Rating (CR) is as follows: CR = Character Level + Level Adjustment
CR is used to determine a character’s relative power compared to other characters.
A character’s CR is never used to determine how or when a character gains new skills and feats, nor does it have any effect on talents, spells, and abilities that use character levels. However, a character’s CR is used to determine how many experience points the character needs to advance in level (see Experience, below).

EXPERIENCE
Characters with a Level Adjustment of +1 or higher do not begin play with 0 XP, as humans and other “baseline” characters do. As representatives of more powerful Shadowkind species, they are assumed to have amassed XP before taking their first class level.  Powerful Shadowkind use their CR instead of level when determining the experience they start with and the amount needed to gain a level.

LANGUAGES OF SHADOW
Creatures who reach our modern world through Shadow gain an innate knowledge of English, Spanish, Russian, or whatever the predominant language happens to be in the area in which they arrive. To them, the language resembles Common, a language that was used in trade or other negotiations between different species in the world of their birth. Whether this is mere coincidence or part of some great design remains a mystery.
“Languages of Shadow” are languages brought to our world by creatures of Shadow. Like Earth languages, these languages can be grouped together in families. Languages that belong to a single family share the same root alphabet. However, knowing one language in a family doesn’t enable characters with the Smart hero’s linguist talent to automatically speak, write, and understand the other languages in that family.
Natives of our world—human and Shadowkind alike—can learn new Shadow languages only after they are exposed to them; they can’t master them spontaneously. To learn Draconic, for example, a character must spend time with creatures that speak Draconic or find someone with access to the written language (Draconic “books on tape” or ancient texts written using the Draconic alphabet, for example). Certain Shadowkind know languages commonly spoken among members of their species, and all characters may study and learn new Shadow languages, investing in the appropriate Read/Write Language and Speak Language skills as they advance in level.
Table: Shadow Languages by Family lists various languages of Shadow and their root alphabets. Shadow language families include the following:
Celestial: Elegant in its simplicity and purity, celestial writing tends to be direct in its language. Spoken, it has a gentle, flowing tone.
Draconic: A florid, powerful alphabet, Draconic is often used for magical messages and inscriptions. It is said to descend from the dragons themselves and is often referred to as the Original Language and the Words of Power.
Dwarven: Using an alphabet similar to the Norse runes, the dwarven alphabet was made to be carved in stone, and its letters look as if they were chiseled in place. Languages in this family are generally rough and heavily accented.
Elven: The elven alphabet is a thin, flowing freehand script with letters overlapping and curling in on themselves, suitable for inscription on metal, ivory, or very hard woods. It is used by elves (including drow) and has a melodic tone when spoken.
Fiendish: The Fiendish alphabet is a jagged, powerful script. The two languages that form this group—Abyssal and Infernal—are dominated by harsh gutturals and accents. Favored by evil outsiders, its presence usually indicates something malefic.
Halfling: The halfling alphabet makes heavy use of pictograms and lettering passingly similar in appearance to musical notes. The spoken language is a patois incorporating elements of Elven combined with distinctive halfling idioms.
Undertongue: Represented by harsh lines and stark hieroglyphs, this debased version of Elven is spoken by countless subterranean species, usually for the purpose of doing business with one another.

Footnote on Sign Languages
Knowing one type of sign language does not grant knowledge of other sign languages. In the mundane world, ASL (American Sign Language) is a dominant form of nonverbal communication in the United States and may be used and understood by any character who takes the Speak American Sign Language skill. However, the communication is in the native language of the speaker. Two characters using ASL to communicate with each other must share another common language.
